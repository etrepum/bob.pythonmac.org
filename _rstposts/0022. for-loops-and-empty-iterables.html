title: for loops and empty iterables

`Just van Rossum`_ and I were discussing the `for:else:`_, `while:else:`_ and `try:else:`_ syntax on the `MacPythonChannel`_ this morning (morning for me, at least).  I'm not sure if this is sufficiently covered elsewhere, but here is the pattern I use to check for empty iterables:

.. pycode::

    class NoValue:
        """A unique placeholder, since None is sometimes used in iterables"""

    def doesSomethingWithIterable(iterable):
        x = NoValue
        for x in iterable:
            pass # something useful could go here ;)
        else:
            if x is NoValue:
                pass # do something because iterable was empty
            else:
                pass # do something because iterable was not empty
