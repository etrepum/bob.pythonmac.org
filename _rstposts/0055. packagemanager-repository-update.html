Another update to my `OS X 10.3 Package Manager repository`_

Updated packages:

  * numarray updated from 0.7 to 0.8, now using Apple's Accelerate framework for LAPACK and BLAS

New packages:

  * pCFITSIO 0.99.0, a SWIG wrapper for CFITSIO (the source looked to be in a pretty sad state, but someone asked for it.. no guarantees).
