title: New Cocoa Bindings examples for PyObjC 1.3
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

A new `PyObjC`_ user has been going through the motions of translating several popular Objective-C `Cocoa Bindings`_ examples to `PyObjC`_.  Unfortunately, due to our lack of documentation and existing examples on the subject, he has been having a bit of trouble with it .  Fortunately, the `pyobjc-dev`_ mailing list has come to the rescue to provide quick and accurate answers to his questions.

So far, he's put together three excellent examples and contributed them to us.  They're already in svn trunk and will be part of `PyObjC`_ 1.3:

* CurrencyConvBinding

  A rewrite of CurrencyConverter using Cocoa Bindings.

  Originally from
  `Introduction to Developing Cocoa Applications Using Bindings`_,
  converted to PyObjC by u.fiedler.

.. _`Introduction to Developing Cocoa Applications Using Bindings`: http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CurrencyConverterBindings/index.html

* ManualBindings

  A simple example that illustrates establishing bindings
  programmatically, including a number of options such as validation
  and an array operator, and indexed accessor methods. A custom model
  object implements custom validation method.

  Originally from `Cocoa Bindings Examples and Hints`_,
  converted to PyObjC by u.fiedler.

.. _`Cocoa Bindings Examples and Hints`: http://homepage.mac.com/mmalc/CocoaExamples/controllers.html

* TemperatureTransformer

  An example that uses ``NSValueTransformer`` to convert between Celsius
  and Fahrenheit.

  Based on Apple's `Value Transformers`_ documentation,
  converted to PyObjC by u.fiedler.
