title: pygame 1.7.0 for Mac OS X 10.3
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

`Pygame`_ is a set of Python modules designed for writing games. It is written on top of the excellent `SDL`_ library. This allows you to create fully featured games and multimedia programs in the `Python language`_. `Pygame`_ is highly portable and runs on nearly every platform and operating system.

.. _`SDL`: http://libsdl.org/
.. _`Python language`: http://python.org/

Although the official sdist tarball isn't cut yet, I've packaged what should be pygame 1.7.0 for Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) users.
It is available from `pythonmac.org packages`_.

.. _`pythonmac.org packages`: http://pythonmac.org/packages/

This installer ships with:

    pygame:
        Installed to ``/Library/Python2.3/``

    pygame headers:
        Installed to ``/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/include/python2.3/``

    pygame examples and documentation:
        Installed to ``/Developer/Python/pygame/``

    `SDL`_ with `my AltiVec patches`_, `SDL_mixer`_, `SDL_ttf`_, `SDL_image`_, `smpeg`_:
        Installed to ``/Library/Frameworks/``

.. _`my AltiVec patches`: http://svn.red-bean.com/bob/SDL-altivec/trunk/
.. _`SDL_mixer`: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
.. _`SDL_ttf`: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
.. _`SDL_image`: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
.. _`smpeg`: http://icculus.org/smpeg/

To use pygame, you will need `PyObjC`_ 1.2 or later, and you will probably want `Numeric`_, `PIL`_ and `PyOpenGL`_ installed.  All of these are also available from `pythonmac.org packages`_.

.. _`PIL`: http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
.. _`PyObjC`: http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/
.. _`Numeric`: http://numeric.scipy.org/
.. _`PyOpenGL`: http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/

The following improvements are especially relevant to Mac OS X:

- Calls into nasty private Apple SPI (``CPSEnableForegroundOperation``) to grab GUI access if it doesn't already have it (read: no ``pythonw`` required)
- Can now read the default font and icon out of any `PEP 302`_ ``get_data`` compliant loader (read: `py2app`_ 0.1.8 can put pygame entirely in the ``site-packages.zip``, and it works!).
- Includes newer versions of all dependencies (it sure has been a long time since 1.6.0!)
- Most surface operations should be significantly faster on G4 and G5 computers due to `my AltiVec patches`_ to `SDL`_

.. _`py2app`: http://undefined.org/python/#py2app
.. _`PEP 302`: http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0302.html

As it has been quite a long time since the last release, there are pages full of bug fixes and feature enhancements.  When `pygame.org`_ updates for the 1.7 release, check `WhatsNew`_.

Note that I will not be making a Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) compatible release for Python 2.3.  When Python 2.4.1 is out (and probably not until there is an official distribution of it), I may build a `pygame`_ release for that.

UPDATE: I built `PyOpenGL`_, with some ugly hacking and lots of compiling.  If there was an award for having a crappy build process, I would nominate `PyOpenGL`_, twice.
