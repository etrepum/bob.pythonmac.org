**24-Feb-04: Stackless Sprint in Berlin**

    A sprint on Stackless Python will be done In Berlin, March 10-14. We are planning to work on auto-scheduling, more softswitching support, documentation, examples, Zope, refactoring Stackless into configurable layers, and more.

I'll be flying out to participate, and hopefully also to meet up with the `MacPython`_ crew in Amsterdam for a few days.. followed immediately by a week of `PyCon`_.
