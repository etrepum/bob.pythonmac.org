title: PyObjC and unicode

.. -*- mode: rst -*-

There's a constant battle in `PyObjC`__ about what to do about regular ``str`` instances, since Foundation doesn't have a data type that's unencoded bytes (``NSData``) and text (``NSString``) at the same time.  Up to now, ``str`` instances were be converted to ``NSString`` using Python's default encoding (``sys.getdefaultencoding()``), which is basically always ``ascii`` and will raise an exception, which is really never what you want.  I committed a change this week that will hopefully be a least worst of both worlds solution:

.. __: http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/

- Added ``OC_PythonUnicode`` and ``OC_PythonString`` classes that
  preserve the identity of ``str`` and ``unicode`` objects across
  the bridge.  Additionally, bridge for ``str`` now uses the default
  encoding of ``NSString``, rather than ``sys.getdefaultencoding()``
  from Python.  For Mac OS X, this is typically MacRoman.  The reason
  for this is that not all Python ``str`` instances could cross the
  bridge at all previously.  ``objc.setStrBridgeEnabled(False)`` will
  still trigger warnings, if you are attempting to track down an
  encoding bug.  However, the symptoms of the bug will be incorrectly
  encoded text, not an exception.

This lets ``NSString`` decide what encoding to use (generally, MacRoman), so you still get garbage in garbage out, but:

- It's lossless (garbage in, same garbage out)
- 7-bit ASCII safe (usually when str is used for text, it is just ascii)
- Doesn't raise exceptions in strange places
- If it was data (not text) and you were just putting it in a container or something, it will still be data when you get it back

NeXT/Apple definitely did strings in a very nice way.  Rather than deciding there should be one and only one way to do them, they made ``NSString`` a class cluster where you can have any concrete implementation you want.  The only methods your concrete classes *have* to implement are:

``-(unsigned)length``:
    Return the number of characters in the string

``-(unichar)characterAtIndex:(unsigned)index``:
    Return the character at that index (or raise an exception)

There are, of course, additional methods that a concrete subclass of ``NSString`` can implement for efficiency.

Doing strings in this way has some nice advantages:

- If they wanted to trade up ``unichar`` to 32 bits, it would require minimal changes to the source code
- You can use whatever backing store you need to use, with whatever properties it needs to have (i.e. mmap backed store, a constant in the code that never gets freed, a length-prefixed string, whatever!)
- You can use whatever encoding you want to use, and conversion doesn't take place until you do something with it

In Python's case, ``OC_PythonUnicode`` is actually a zero-copy concrete subclass of ``NSString`` (if Python's unicode characters are the same size as unichar, anyway).  Python can't do ANYTHING like this:

- The backing store of a Python unicode object must be controlled by Python (i.e. you can't point to a constant string, you can't point to a slice of another unicode object, etc.).  This throws zero-copy strategies out the window.
- The encoding of a Python unicode object must be UCS-2 (or UCS-4, depending on configure time options)

So, that sucks... but at least Python does have good unicode support, unlike some other languages with similar heritage.
