title: pickle those iterators
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-
.. original id: P33

I made a small patch to the `Stackless`_ 2.3 branch today: iterator pickling.  It now pickles/unpickles all of the private iterator types (that I know of) in Python's builtins:  dictionary-iterator, listiterator, rangeiterator, tupleiterator.  I'm sure it will be in CVS pretty soon.

.. pycode::
    
    Python 2.3.3 Stackless 3.0 040119 (#5, Jan 25 2004, 11:26:07) 
    [GCC 3.3 20030304 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 1495)] on darwin

    >>> from pickle import loads, dumps
    >>> a = iter(range(10))
    >>> a
    <stackless.listiterator object at 0x3d0d50>>>> a.next()
    0
    >>> a.next()
    1
    >>> b = loads(dumps(a)) 
    >>> a.next()
    2
    >>> b.next()
    2
