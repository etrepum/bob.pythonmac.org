NOTE:

    This is an announcement for a BETA release of `PyObjC`_.  Though we know it to be quite stable, and have been using it on a daily basis for quite some time, use it at your own risk.  1.3.0 will be out in a matter of days, but it is essential that we get some eyes on this!

.. _`PyObjC`: http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/

Installer package available from:
    http://pythonmac.org/packages/ (note that the installer also contains `py2app`_ 0.1.8)

.. _`py2app`: http://undefined.org/python/#py2app

Version 1.3 (2005-03-??)
------------------------

- The bridge now maintains object identity across the bridge
  in both directions. Previous versions of the bridge only did this when
  bridging from Objective-C to Python.

  Exceptions: NSString and NSNumber do not have unique proxies. NSString
  never will have. Python numbers and strings are converted, not proxied and
  therefore also don't get unique proxies.

  And finally, any python object that is proxied using the ``__pyobjc_object__``
  interface will only get a unique proxy if the ``__pyobjc_object__`` method
  implements that feature.

- New ``objc.protocolsForClass`` function that returns a list of protocols
  that the class directly claims to conform to.

- PyObjC classes can now declare that they implement formal protocols,
  for example::

    class MyLockingClass(NSObject, objc.protocolNamed('NSLocking')):
        # implementation
        pass

  It is also possible to define new protocols::

     MyProtocol = objc.formal_protocol("MyProtocol", None, [
     	selector(None, selector='mymethod', signature='v@:'),
     ])

  All formal protocols are instances of ``objc.formal_protocol``.
        
- PyObjCTools.KeyValueCoding has a new ``kvc`` class that allows
  Pythonic Key-Value Coding.

  - ``__getitem__`` is mapped to ``valueForKeyPath:``
  - ``__setitem__`` is mapped to ``setValue:forKeyPath:``
  - ``__getattr__`` is mapped to ``valueForKey:``
  - ``__setattr__`` is mapped to ``setValue:forKey:``

  The ``kvc`` class uses ``__pyobjc_object__``, so it may cross the bridge
  as the wrapped object.

- ``NSNumber`` instances are bridged to a ``float``, ``long``, or ``int``
  subclass that uses ``__pyobjc_object__``.  
  ``NSDecimal`` is converted to ``NSDecimalNumber`` when used as an object,
  ``NSDecimalNumber`` is not bridged to ``NSDecimal`` because the latter is
  a mutable type.

- The Python to Objective-C bridge now looks for a ``__pyobjc_object__`` 
  attribute to get a PyObjC object from a Python object.

- New IDNSnitch example in Inject that demonstrates how to write an
  monitor for the launch of another application,
  use ``objc.inject`` to load code into a target process,
  and override the implementation of an existing method but still
  call back into the original implementation (method swizzling).

- ``objc.IMP`` should do the right thing now.  This type is returned
  by ``+[NSObject methodForSelector:]`` and
  ``+[NSObject instanceMethodForSelector:]``

- New ToDos example in CocoaBindings that demonstrates how to use
  two array controllers for the same data, and how to use value
  transformers to alter the color of text.  Originally from
  "Cocoa Bindings Examples and Hints", converted to PyObjC by u.fiedler.

- New Bookmarks example in CocoaBindings that demonstrates how to
  subclass ``NSArrayController`` to implement the ``NSTableView``
  delegate drag and drop protocol, including copying of objects between
  documents and accepting URL drops from other applications.  Also
  demonstrates re-ordering of the content array.  Originally from
  "Cocoa Bindings Examples and Hints", converted to PyObjC by u.fiedler.

- New FilteringController example in CocoaBindings that demonstrates
  how to subclass ``NSArrayController`` to implement filtering
  of a ``NSTableView``.  Also demonstrates the use of indexed accessors.
  Originally from "Cocoa Bindings Examples and Hints", converted to PyObjC
  by u.fiedler.

- New ControlledPreferences example in CocoaBindings that demonstrates
  how to use Cocoa Bindings to simplify storing and retrieving user
  preferences.  Originally from "Cocoa Bindings Examples and Hints",
  converted to PyObjC by u.fiedler.

- New TemperatureTransformer example in CocoaBindings that demonstrates
  how to use NSValueTransfomers with PyObjC.  Based on Apple's
  "Cocoa: Value Transformers" documentation, converted to PyObjC
  by u.fiedler.

- New CurrencyConvBindings example in CocoaBindings that demonstrates
  a Cocoa Bindings enabled version of the CurrencyConverter example.
  Converted to PyObjC by u.fiedler from the example in Apple's
  "Introduction to Developing Cocoa Applications Using Bindings".

- New ManualBindings example in CocoaBindings that demonstrates how
  to develop programmatic bindings from a PyObjC application.
  Converted to PyObjC by u.fiedler from the "Cocoa Bindings and Hints"
  example of the same name.

- New HotKeyPython example in AppKit that demonstrates how to use
  Carbon global hot keys from a PyObjC application.  Also demonstrates
  how to use a NSApplication subclass.

- Key-Value Observing support is now automatic in Python classes that
  descend from ``NSObject``, unless they implement a custom
  ``willChangeValueForKey:``, ``didChangeValueForKey:``, or
  ``__useKVO__`` is not True.  This allows ``self.foo = 1`` to
  automatically trigger notifications.  This works in all cases,
  whether ``foo`` is a ``property``, ``ivar``, or just in the
  ``__dict__``.

- New Inject folder in Examples, with an InjectInterpreter
  example that will inject a GUI Python interpreter into any process.

- New ``objc.inject()`` function for Mac OS X 10.3 and later,
  allows an arbitrary bundle to be loaded into another process
  using mach_inject.

- ``objc.classAddMethods`` now recognizes and supports
  classmethods.

- GC is now correctly implemented for struct wrappers.

- The ``NSNumber`` bridge has been removed, now you will get
  ``NSNumber`` instances across the bridge instead of a
  Python representation.

- ``PyObjCTools.AppHelper.runEventLoop()`` will now bring your
  application to the front at startup when using pdb
  mode for convenience.

- ``objc.loadBundle()`` no longer filters the class list.  This
  solves a few potential issues and shaves off about 1/3rd of
  the overhead of ``python -c "import AppKit"``.

- ``PyObjCTools.AppHelper.runEventLoop()`` no longer breaks on
  pure Objective-C exceptions.  Most exceptions of this variety
  are more like warnings, and there is nothing that can be done
  them anyway.

- ``PyObjCTools.AppHelper.runEventLoop()`` now installs the
  interrupt handler and verbose exception logging when using pdb,
  either explicitly or by the USE_PDB environment variable.

- There is now a fast path for the ``NSString``/``unicode``
  bridge when ``Py_UNICODE_SIZE`` is 2.  This is the default
  setting for Python.

- The default selector signature will have a void return value
  unless a "return" statement with an argument is used in the
  bytecode.  In that case, it will default to an object return
  value.

- ``__bundle_hack__`` is no longer necessary, py2app now sets
  a different environment variable to the current plugin during
  execution, and a hack is installed to ``NSBundle`` so that classes
  may respond to requests for their bundle with the ``+bundleForClass``
  method.  The class builder adds a default implementation of this to
  Python classes if this environment variable is set.

- Added ``objc.currentBundle()``, which is equivalent to
  ``NSBundle.mainBundle()`` except after loading a plug-in.
  Makes it easier to load nib files.

- ``PyObjCTools.NibClassBuilder.extractClasses()`` now uses
  ``objc.currentBundle()`` instead of ``NSBundle.mainBundle()``.  This
  makes plugins less of a hassle to develop and allows identical code
  to be used for application or plugin development.

- ``objc.registerPlugin()`` and ``objc.pluginBundle()`` are now deprecated
  as they are no longer useful.

- It is now possible to subclass a class that implements ``copyWithZone:``
  without setting ``__slots__`` to ``()``.
