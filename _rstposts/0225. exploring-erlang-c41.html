title: Exploring Erlang @ C4[1]

.. -*- mode: rst -*-

Slides from my Exploring Erlang talk today at `C4[1]`_ are available here: http://undefined.org/c4-1/

Yes, it is definitely `caturday`_.

For those of you interested in learning more about `Erlang`_, I highly recommend buying `Joe Armstrong`_'s `Programming Erlang`_ and/or read his 2003 ph.d thesis, which is kinda similar in content to his book but is more technical and is freely available: `Making Reliable Distributed Systems in the Presence of Software Errors`_. The thesis is a bit more dense, but it was what really made `Erlang`_ "click" for me.

If you want to play with the examples, go to `CEAN`_ and download "Erlang/OTP Full (Standard)" at the bottom for you version of Mac OS X and follow the "How do I install CEAN to /usr/local/bin" `FAQ entry`_. Alternatively, if you want to wait longer, you could use `MacPorts`_ to download and compile it. Once you've got that set up just run ``erl`` from the examples directory in the slides download and it *should* all work.
