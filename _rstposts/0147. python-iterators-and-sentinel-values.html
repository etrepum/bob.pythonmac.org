title: Python iterators and sentinel values
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

A little known feature of `PEP 234: Iterators`_ (implemented in Python 2.1 and later) is the alternate form:

.. pycode::

    iter(callable, sentinel)

This form creates an iterator out of any callable, and will stop when an exception is raised or the sentinel value is returned by the callable.  Additionally, raising ``StopIteration`` will stop the iteration as with a normal iterator.  A sentinel value is a special value that indicates the end of a sequence.  This can be any value, but the most commonly useful values are likely to be ``None``, ``0``, or ``''``.

I haven't seen much code in the wild that takes advantage of this form of ``iter``, but an excellent usage would be to replace this common idiom:

.. pycode::

    while True:
        data = fileobj.read(BLOCKSIZE)
        if not data:
            break
        # do something with data here

Using the sentinel form of ``iter``, it can be rewritten as an iterator with more obvious control flow:

.. pycode::

    for data in iter(lambda: fileobj.read(BLOCKSIZE), ''):
        # do something with data here

Of course, nobody likes a ``lambda``, but you could wrap this up as a little utility function, or you could wait for `PEP 309: Partial Function Application`_ (on the standards track, will be in Python 2.5).  With ``partial`` it would look like this:

.. pycode::

    for data in iter(partial(fileobj.read, BLOCKSIZE), ''):
        # do something with data here
