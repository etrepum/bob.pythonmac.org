I started ripping apart `py2exe`_ to see what tasty little chunks could be used in py2app (its evil Mac OS X clone-to-be).  It seems like a lot of `py2exe`_ is almost cross-platform-ish, but most of the logic is just in one huge Python script.

So far the only working code I have is the `modulefinder`_ based code, plus a whole bunch of hacks to ignore modules that should be ignored.  The result is `find_modules.py`_, which is almost 400 lines long and should be totally cross-platform-ish (far more so than `py2exe`_, anyway).  Basically it knows how to ignore a non-definitive list of platform specific modules based upon which platform you're currently using.

Perhaps at some point this little ugly monster could be shared between several packaging projects (`py2exe`_, py2app, `cx_Freeze`_, etc.)?  I'm not sure if it can go into `py2exe`_ as-is, because I used a bunch of Python 2.3+ features.
