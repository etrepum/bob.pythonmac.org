title: PEP 326 -- A Case for Top and Bottom Values
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-
.. original id: P24

`PEP 326`_ gets my vote, with one condition:  change cmp.high and cmp.low!  Why not just use max and min respectively?  This follows the `discussion`_ Josiah Carlson and I had on `his livejournal`_.

For the uninitiated, `PEP 326`_ proposes that Python should have builtins that represent the smallest and largest possible object values regardless of object type.  The smallest value will always return -1 for cmp unless it is compared with itself, in which case it returns 0.  It's rather obvious what the largest value will do :)
