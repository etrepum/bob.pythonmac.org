title: Lessons learned in Asia

.. -*- mode: rst -*-

- Food is cheap in Taipei and Shanghai
- Alcohol isn't
- US internet connectivity in Taipei is kinda slow and high latency
- US internet connectivity in Shanghai is even worse; barely usable
- An earthquake in Taiwan can make Shanghai's US connectivity completely unusable for days. Going on 6 now; still slower than dial-up 10 years ago.
- The great firewall blocking sites like wikipedia, google's cache and wordpress can get annoying. It's also hard to tell if a site is just unreachable or is blocked by the great firewall.
- Google knows what the hell they're doing (and nobody else seems to). They're the only US company I've found that has maintained a usable infrastructure in Shanghai through this whole mess. Not Yahoo, not Microsoft, just Google. If Google had a proxy, I could've gotten by pretty nicely.
- Localized sites for US companies work fine because they're hosted domestically, but I can't read them (e.g. apple.com.cn).
- MacBook Pro power supplies really do melt, and they cost twice as much in Shanghai than *retail* from Apple in the US. No wonder people outside the US don't buy Apple!
