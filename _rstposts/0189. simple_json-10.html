`simple_json`_ is a simple, fast, complete, correct and extensible `JSON`_ encoder/decoder for Python 2.3+.  It's pure Python code with no dependencies.

`simple_json`_ exists because `json-py`_ sucks.  `simple_json`_ is a drop-in replacement for `json-py`_, but it also exposes more sanely named APIs, and can be extended by subclassing.

Here are the issues I found in `json-py`_ after evaluating the source:

- LGPL (does this license have a clear interpretation for Python modules?)
- Doesn't have a proper egg (or source) distribution on `Cheese Shop`_.
- Wonky API.  ``read`` and ``write`` are very bad names to call something that doesn't act file-like!
- No streaming encoder support.
- The decoder is extremely inefficient as it invokes at least one method call per character of input.
- The encoder supports *exactly* these types: ``dict``, ``list``, ``tuple``, ``str``, ``unicode``, ``int``, ``long``, ``float`` plus the singletons ``True``, ``False``, and ``None``.  It can't be made to support anything else, not even subclasses of those types.  The implementation is in a single function and has no extensibility hook.
- The encoder has no clue about unicode.  Depending on the input, it may return a ``str`` or ``unicode``.  It has no option to escape the output.
- The decoder similarly has no clue about unicode.  If it ain't ASCII or escaped, then *BOOM*!
- It uses custom exception subclasses that descend directly from ``Exception``, so will not be caught by traditional ``ValueError`` clauses.
- The source code mixes tabs and spaces.  That's uh.. reassuring :)

`simple_json`_ is designed to address all of those issues:

- MIT license
- It's on `Cheese Shop`_, so `setuptools`_ users can depend on it with a simple ``install_requires``
- The official API follows the familiar convention of marshal and pickle
- Encoding can be streamed (via dump or iterator)
- The decoder is fast, because it uses regular expressions rather than processing each character with Python code
- The encoder can be subclassed and extended to support serialization of any type, and it supports subclasses of ``dict``, ``list``, ``str``, etc. by default
- The encoder outputs ASCII by default, with unicode characters escaped with ``\uXXXX``.  Optionally, it can also output a unicode string with ``ensure_ascii=False``.
- The decoder understands encoded strings (and unicode).  It defaults to UTF-8, but can use anything ASCII-based.  If the input is of an encoding that is not ASCII-based (such as UCS-2), it can be decoded to unicode first.
- Exceptions during encoding or decoding are simply ``ValueError`` (though a future version could provide more informative messages)
