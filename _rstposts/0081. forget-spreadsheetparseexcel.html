title: Forget Spreadsheet::ParseExcel!

I've been working on some automation scripts to take data out of excel and do useful things with it, and I hit a big stumbling block with ``Spreadsheet::ParseExcel``.  Unicode SUCKS in Perl, and ``Spreadsheet::ParseExcel`` does nothing at all to help you with that.  Each cell gets its own encoding ('ucs2', '_native_' which I haven't seen, or it's simply undef.. which seems to be latin-1).  Anyway, it's completely bogus, so I started shopping around for another implementation.

`Andy Khan`_'s `JExcelApi`_ does the trick and is light-years more correct and faster than the alternatives I have tried (other than the time it takes a JVM to start).  Not only that, but *by default* the jar does exactly what I want it to do.  It gets the unicode right, and everything worked perfectly the first time.  My dealings with Excel files have been reduced to the following:

.. pycode::

    java -jar -Djxl.encoding=latin1 jxl.jar -xml EXCELFILE.xls

And the Python code to parse the workbook xml document from jxl looks roughly like this:

.. pycode::

    from xml.dom import minidom

    def parseDocRows(doc):
        for row in doc.getElementsByTagName(u'row'):
            rowdata = [
                u''.join([x.nodeValue for x in col.childNodes])
                for col in row.getElementsByTagName(u'col')]
            if rowdata:
                yield rowdata

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        import sys
        for row in parseDocRows(minidom.parse(file(sys.argv[1]))):
            print row

Thanks!
