title: reStructuredText and WordPress
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

Well, I've installed `WordPress`_, because it was a lot easier than anything else that can use `reStructuredText`_.  I'm using a slightly `modified version`_ of `this plugin`_.  Hopefully I'll be able to whip together some quick scripts to import all of the entries from the old PyDS (ughh) blog and post them here, probably with the XML-RPC interface.

This post was written with `MarsEdit`_ 1.0, but I would like something that understands `reStructuredText`_ in the future.  Maybe a future version will allow me to write a `PyObjC`_ plugin that gives it this support?
