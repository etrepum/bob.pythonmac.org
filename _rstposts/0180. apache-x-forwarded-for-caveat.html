title: Apache X-Forwarded-For caveat
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

When using Apache's mod_proxy in a reverse proxying scenario, usually you'll want to take a look at the (seemingly undocumented) X-Forwarded-For header.  This header contains *whatever the client sent for X-Forwarded-For* (if anything), plus the remote IP address of the client.

So, if you're trying to do anything with this header, check for commas and pick out the *last* piece, because the client can send anything they want to, and you shouldn't ever trust the client:

.. pycode::

    def get_request_ip(request):
        """get the IP of a request in twisted.web-speak"""
        host = request.transport.getPeer().host
        # Twisted doesn't support IPv6 anyway :)
        if host != "127.0.0.1":
            return host
        header = request.received_headers.get('x-forwarded-for', None)
        if header is None:
            return host
        return header.split(',')[-1].strip()


I gleaned this from reading the Apache 2.0.54 source, I couldn't find any description of the behavior of mod_proxy in Apache's docs, only how to configure it.  I was surprised that it even preserved what the client sent!
