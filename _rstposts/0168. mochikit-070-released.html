title: MochiKit 0.70 Released
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

`MochiKit 0.70`_ has been released!  This release includes a new example, a bunch of new features, a minor API change, and some bug fixes.

In addition to the new features, there's a spiffy new example: `Ajax Tables`_, which is an extension of the `Sortable Tables from Scratch`_ example that loads data with XMLHttpRequest (in either `JSON`_ or XML format!).

Thanks to some help from `Alex Russell`_, `MochiKit`_ is now packed by the custom `Rhino`_ interpreter from `Dojo Toolkit`_ (though I wouldn't have needed help if it were documented ;).  Despite the new features, ``packed/MochiKit/MochiKit.js`` is 33% smaller than the 0.60 release (chocolate rations are up to 72k from 108k this week)!

2005-08-04      v0.70

- New ajax_tables example, which shows off XMLHttpRequest, ajax, json, and
  a little TAL-ish DOM templating attribute language.
- sendXMLHttpRequest and functions that use it (loadJSONDoc, etc.) no longer
  ignore requests with status == 0, which seems to happen for cached or local
  requests
- Added sendXMLHttpRequest to MochiKit.Async.EXPORT, d'oh.
- Changed scrapeText API to return a string by default.  This is API-breaking!
  It was dumb to have the default return value be the form you almost never
  want.  Sorry.
- Added special form to swapDOM(dest, src).  If src is null, dest is removed
  (where previously you'd likely get a DOM exception).
- Added three new functions to MochiKit.Base for dealing with URL query
  strings: urlEncode, queryString, parseQueryString
- MochiKit.DOM.createDOM will now use attr[k] = v for all browsers if the name
  starts with "on" (e.g. "onclick").  If v is a string, it will set it to
  new Function(v).
- Another workaround for Internet "worst browser ever" Explorer's setAttribute
  usage in MochiKit.DOM.createDOM (checked -> defaultChecked).
- Added UL, OL, LI convenience createDOM aliases to MochiKit.DOM
- Packing is now done by Dojo's custom Rhino interpreter, so it's much smaller
  now!
