title: Disabling a CPU with the CHUD framework
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

`Xcode Tools`_ has an optional component, `CHUD Tools`_ (Computer Hardware Understanding Development Tools), that consists of some useful performance tools and low-level hardware facilities.  My Dual 2ghz G5 has been having some serious stability problems lately, with what I believe is a dying CPU or logic board.  When I saw errant CPU messages in the system log after experiencing unexplicable kernel panics and crashes I decided to see what would happen if I toggled the second CPU off with the Hardware preference pane that ships with CHUD.  It worked!  My G5 is now usable (though I will of course still get it repaired, but it's not convenient to do so at this time).

Unfortunately, when I reboot the machine, this setting is lost and all bets are off as to whether I'll be able to disable the second CPU before the machine crashes, so I decided to look into what I could do.  I opened up the Hardware preference pane nib with Interface Builder to see what message was sent to change the CPU count (unsurprisingly, ``setCPUCount:``), then I used `class-dump`_ to find the implementation address of that message.  I then did an `otool`_ disassembly of the Hardware preference pane (``otool -tVv ...``) so that I could see what the code looked like at that address.  It called an unconspicuously named function ``chudSetNumProcessors`` from the ``CHUDCore.framework`` subframework of the umbrella ``CHUD.framework``, which happens to ship with *documented headers*!

At first, I tried writing a simple C program that naively called right into ``chudSetNumProcessors``, which returned an error code that I didn't expect (from the documentation): something about the kext not being loaded.  I knew the kext was indeed loaded, because the Hardware preference pane works and I've used `Shark`_ recently, so I looked at the headers for initialization functions.  Unsurprisingly, I needed to call ``chudInitialize`` before trying to talk to the CHUD kext, so I ended up with the following program:

.. pycode::

    /*
    % cc -o setNumProcessors setNumProcessors.c -framework CHUD
    */

    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <CHUD/CHUD.h>

    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        int rval = 0;
        int status = chudInitialize();
        if (status != chudSuccess) {
            fprintf(stderr, "FATAL: Could not initialize chud, error %dn", chudInitialize());
            return -1;
        }
        if (argc == 2) {
            int cpuCount;
            int curCPUCount = chudProcessorCount();
            int physCPUCount = chudPhysicalProcessorCount();
            sscanf(argv[1], "%d", &cpuCount);
            if (cpuCount < 1 || cpuCount > physCPUCount) {
                fprintf(stderr, "CPU count of %d not acceptable, expecting between 1 and %dn", cpuCount, physCPUCount);
                rval = -1;
            } else {
                int res;
                res = chudSetNumProcessors(cpuCount);
                if (res != chudSuccess) {
                    fprintf(stderr, "Could not change CPU count to %d, error %dn", cpuCount, res);
                    rval = -1;
                }
            }
        } else if (argc > 2) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Must take zero or one argumentsn");
            rval = -1;
        }
        printf("CPU Count: %d of %dn", chudProcessorCount(), chudPhysicalProcessorCount());
        chudCleanup();
        return -1;
    }

Now I can call this setNumProcessors application early on in the boot process and increase my odds of being able to use my computer on reboot!

UPDATE:  `rentzsch`_ commented with a better solution.  It's also possible to disable multiprocessing even earlier by twiddling a setting in Open Firmware (`QA1141`_).
