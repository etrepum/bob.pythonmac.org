title: Using setuptools features with distutils scripts
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

A quick and dirty way to use `setuptools`_ commands (such as `develop`_, `bdist_egg`_, etc.) given a standard distutils setup.py file is to just add an "import setuptools" statement to the top of the script.  This can also be done without modifying the setup.py as such::

    python -c "import setuptools; execfile('setup.py')" develop

It would be cool if `setuptools`_ shipped with a script for this, or if `buildutils`_ had that functionality built-in.
