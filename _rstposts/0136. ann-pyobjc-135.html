PyObjC 1.3.5 is now available for download at http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/

PyObjC is a bridge between Python and Objective-C.  It allows full
featured Cocoa applications to be written in pure Python.  It is also
easy to use other frameworks containing Objective-C class libraries
from Python and to mix in Objective-C, C and C++ source.

Python is a highly dynamic programming language with a shallow learning
curve.  It combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.

The installer package includes a number of Xcode templates
for easily creating new Cocoa-Python projects, as well as py2app,
a suite of tools for building redistributable Python applications
and plugins.

PyObjC also supports full introspection of Objective-C classes and
direct invocation of Objective-C APIs from the interactive interpreter.

PyObjC requires Mac OS X 10.2 or later and Python 2.3 or later.  PyObjC
works with the Apple provided Python installation in Mac OS X 10.3 (and later),
MacPython 2.3, and MacPython 2.4.

This release features several bugfixes, improved documentation, new Xcode
templates, Tiger support and many major enhancements.  See the news file at
http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/NEWS-1.3.5.txt for more information.

PyObjC is released with an open source license (MIT style).
