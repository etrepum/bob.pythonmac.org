title: '2005: The Year of PyObjC'
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

This year is going to be huge for `PyObjC`_:

- Apple is `paying attention`_.
- We're going to have 3 major releases in 6 months (1.2 was at the end of December, 1.3 final will be out this week, and 1.4 will be out by `WWDC 2005`_)
- `Tiger`_.  More frameworks, better existing frameworks.  Expect to see some Cool Stuff out of the box in `PyObjC`_ 1.4!

I could say a lot more here, but I'm under NDA and I have a lot of code to write anyhow :)
