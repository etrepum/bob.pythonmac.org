I started hacking on `py2app`_ again, and it's to the point where it can build applications now.  What it does:

* Uses a bootstrap executable (like the PyObjC Xcode template, unlike bundlebuilder).  It *does not* require a compiler to do this, it's precompiled with source included.
* Finds Python dependencies and stuffs them into a zip in the application bundle (some.app/Contents/Resources/Python/site-packages.zip).  This is basically "semi-standalone" in bundlebuilder terms.

What it doesn't do, yet:

* Non-zip distribution mode
* dylib dependency hunting and rewriting (bundlebuilder2 / macholib)
* Standalone
* Plugins (preference panes, etc.)
* Haven't tried or tested including non-code resources or full packages
* Haven't yet tried doing anything non-trivial
* No way to avoid the modulefinder step (should have a way to manually specify dependencies)
* Take a template plist or additional plist arguments
