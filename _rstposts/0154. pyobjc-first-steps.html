title: PyObjC First Steps
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

I've been neglecting Python a bit lately, but Ronald is going to cut a release of `PyObjC`_ 1.3.7 very soon, hopefully later this week.  `PyObjC`_ 1.3.7 fixes a few bugs (particularly with Xcode 2.1 templates), has a more complete wrapping of Mac OS X 10.4 system frameworks (DiscRecording, SenTestingKit, SecurityFoundation), and adds a new TinyURLService example (which converts URLs on the pasteboard to `tinyurl.com`_ equivalents).

There's also a swath of new "First Steps" documentation in the PyObjC intro, which I wrote up earlier today:

First Steps
-----------

When dealing with the Objective-C runtime, there are certain patterns
you need to learn when writing Python code.  If you're not already an
Objective-C programmer, some of them will seem strange or even
"un-pythonic" at first.  However, you will get used to it, and the way
that PyObjC works is quite compliant with the `Zen of Python`_
(``import this``).  In fact, Ronald is Dutch ;)

.. _`Zen of Python`: http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0020.html

With no further ado, here are the three most important things you
*must* know before embarking on any PyObjC voyage:

Underscores, and lots of them
.............................

Objective-C objects communicate with each other by sending messages.
The syntax for messages is somewhere in-between Python's positional and
keyword arguments.  Specificlaly, Objective-C message dispatch uses
positional arguments, but parts of the message name (called "selector"
in Objective-C terminology) are interleaved with the arguments.

An Objective-C message looks like this:

.. pycode::

    [someObject doSomething:arg1 withSomethingElse:arg2];

The selector (message name) for the above snippet is this (note the colons):

.. pycode::

    doSomething:withSomethingElse:

In order to have a lossless and unambiguous translation between Objective-C
messages and Python methods, the Python method name equivalent is simply
the selector with colons replaced by underscores.  Since each colon in an
Objective-C selector is a placeholder for an argument, the number of
underscores in the PyObjC-ified method name is the number of arguments
that should be given.

The PyObjC translation of the above selector is (note the underscores):

.. pycode::

    doSomething_withSomethingElse_

The message dispatch, translated to PyObjC, looks like this:

.. pycode::

    someObject.doSomething_withSomethingElse_(arg1, arg2)

*Methods that take one argument will have a trailing underscore*.

It may take a little while to get used to, but PyObjC does not ever
rename selectors.  The trailing underscore will seem strange at first,
especially for cases like this:

.. pycode::

    # note the trailing underscore
    someObject.setValue_(aValue)

There are a few additional rules regarding message dispatch, see the
Overview of the bridge for the complete rundown.

Two-phase instantiation
.......................

Objective-C, being a low-level runtime, separates the two concepts required
to instantiate an object.

allocation:
    Reserve a chunk of memory large enough to hold the new object, and make
    sure that all of its declared instance variables are set to "zero"
    (this means nil pointers to objects, 0 for integers, etc.).

initialization:
    Fill in the blank slate allocated by the allocation phase.

In Objective-C, the convention is for allocation to be performed by a class
method called ``alloc``, and initialization is done with method
*beginning with* the word ``init``.  For example, here is the syntax for
instantiating an ``NSObject``:

.. pycode::

    myObject = NSObject.alloc().init()

And here is an example for creating an ``NSData`` instance given a few bytes:

.. pycode::

    myData = NSData.alloc().initWithBytes_length_('the bytes', 9)

You must also follow this convention when subclassing Objective-C classes.
When initializing, an object must always (directly or indirectly) call the
designated initializer of its ``super``.  The designated initializer is the
"most basic" initializer through which all initialization eventually ends up.
The designated initializer for ``NSObject`` is ``init``.  To find the
designated initializer for other classes, consult the documentation for that
class.  Here is an example of an ``NSObject`` subclass with a customized
initialization phase:

.. pycode::

    class MyClass(NSObject):

        def init(self):
            """
            Designated initializer for MyClass
            """
            # ALWAYS call the super's designated initializer.
            # Also, make sure to re-bind "self" just in case it
            # returns something else!
            self = super(MyClass, self).init()
    
            self.myVariable = 10

            # Unlike Python's __init__, initializers MUST return self,
            # because they are allowed to return any object!
            return self

    class MyOtherClass(MyClass):

        def initWithOtherVariable_(self, otherVariable):
            """
            Designated initializer for MyOtherClass
            """
            self = super(MyOtherClass, self).init()
            self.otherVariable = otherVariable
            return self

    myInstance = MyClass.alloc().init()
    myOtherInstance = MyOtherClass.alloc().initWithOtherVariable_(20)

Many Objective-C classes provide class methods that perform two-phase 
instantiation for you in one step.  Several examples of this are:

.. pycode::

    # This is equivalent to:
    #
    #   myObject = NSObject.alloc().init()
    #
    myObject = NSObject.new()

    # This is equivalent to:
    #
    #   myDict = NSDictionary.alloc().init()
    #
    myDict = NSDictionary.dictionary()

    # This is equivalent to:
    #
    #   myString = NSString.alloc().initWithString_(u'my string')
    #
    myString = NSString.stringWithString_(u'my string')
    
Objective-C uses accessors everywhere
.....................................

Unlike Python, Objective-C convention says to use accessors rather than
directly accessing instance variables of other objects.  This means
that in order to access an instance variable ``value`` of an object
``valueContainer`` you will have to use the following syntax:

.. pycode::
    
    # Getting
    # 
    # notice the method call
    #
    myValue = valueContainer.value()
    
    # Setting
    # 
    # notice the naming convention and trailing underscore
    #
    valueContainer.setValue_(myNewValue)

When writing your own classes from Python, this is a bit harder since
Python only has one namespace for all attributes, even methods.  If you
choose to implement accessors from Python, then you will have to name
the instance variable something else:

.. pycode::
    
    class MyValueHolder(NSObject):
        
        def initWithValue_(self, value):
            self = super(MyValueHolder, self).init()
            # It's recommended not to use typical Python convention here,
            # as instance variables prefixed with underscores are reserved
            # by the Objective-C runtime.  It still works if you use
            # underscores, however.
            self.ivar_value = value
            return self
        
        def value(self):
            return self.ivar_value
        
        def setValue_(self, value):
            self.ivar_value = value

It's also possible to use Key-Value Coding in some cases, which eliminates
the need for writing most accessors, but only in scenarios where the rest of
the code is using it.
