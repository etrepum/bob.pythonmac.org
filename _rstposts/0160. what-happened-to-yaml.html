title: What happened to YAML?
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

I remember hearing about `YAML`_ quite some time ago, but it seems to have completely disappeared from the Python radar.  However, it has become quite popular in Perl (where it's `used by Module::Build for metadata`_) and Ruby (it's a `standard feature`_, even).  What's up with that?

I can't even find a complete `YAML`_ parser/serializer for Python.  The stuff on `python.yaml.org`_ looks `broken and old`_, and I haven't seen anything anywhere else.

The only reason I really care is that the `JSAN distribution format`_ mirrors `CPAN`_ in many ways, ``META.yml`` included, and I have to drop down to Perl or Ruby if I want to generate it programmatically!  That's not right.  Wasn't the `progenitor of YAML`_ a Python guy?  I remember seeing him on the `Twisted`_ lists years ago.  What happened?
