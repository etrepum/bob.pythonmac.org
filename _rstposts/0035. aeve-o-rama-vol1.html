I've been working on totally rewriting `aeve`_ the past well, too long.  This week I've made some huge progress.  This is the beginning of a series of blog entries where I'm going to talk about the different components of aeve.  I will probably only talk about ones that are finished, or mostly finished :)  Today I'm just going to stick to the ones that have nothing in particular to do with Apple Events.

``aeve._hacks``

aeve._hacks is a package where I store things I shouldn't have to do, and it is the source of any
import time side-effects that aeve has.  Currently the only things in there are the Python 2.4 CVS versions
of applesingle, and pprint.  applesingle was replaced because it throws a string exception and because it
has warnings.  pprint was replaced because the Python 2.3 version won't pretty-print subclasses of 
pretty-printable types.  Both of these hacks happen immediately on import of the aeve package, but nothing
happens if you happen to be running a build of Python 2.4.

``aeve.util``

aeve.util is my repository for generic usable-elsewhere cross-platform Python code.  I am pretty sure that
I'm done with all of the modules in here.

``aeve.util.Enumerations``

This is one of my favories, and is strangely enough inspired by a similar construct in C#.  
In C# you can add metadata to just about anything (I think it's called attributes).  
You can, of course, do this in Python, but it's less of a "meta-protocol" than it is in C# 
(which has syntax support for the feature).  aeve carries around a lot of enumerations whose enumerators
need to carry around metadata (such as enumeration it came from, or its name).  It works by making a 
per-enumeration subclass of the desired base type that has a modified __new__ and __repr__, and 
carries around a reference to the parent enumeration.  The base type is typically int but in aeve 
it's usually a FourCharCode.  FourCharCode is a str subclass that will __new__ from an int by 
struct.pack.  The reason for this (as opposed to regular str) is that new-style Apple header files 
use integers to represent four char codes that contain macroman characters, presumably so that the header
files are unix-tool friendly (7-bit unambiguous good ol' american ASCII).  Enough of that, this is how it looks:

.. pycode::

    >>> from aeve.util import Enumerations
    >>> class MyEnum(Enumerations.Enumeration):
    ...   a = 1
    ...   b = 2
    ... 
    >>> MyEnum.a
    MyEnum.a
    >>> MyEnum.a + 4
    5
    >>> MyEnum.fromName('a')
    MyEnum.a
    >>> MyEnum.fromValue(1)
    MyEnum.a
    >>> MyEnum.fromValue(1).enumeration
    <class '__main__.MyEnum'>

``aeve.util.NamedTuple``

I've talked about this one before, but I just want to let Just know that I `took all the lambdas out`_ ;)  NamedTuple is used to build magically delicious tuple trees out of terminologies.  I wrote this so that
I could introspect the objects (used in aeteViewer: `pdf screenshot`_), but primarily because using 
named attributes instead of arbitrary indexes is a whole hell of a lot nicer to look at.  It's now 
relatively easy to tell what aeve.compiler.core is doing, for example.

``aeve.util.descriptors``

Here's where I'm going to stash all of the generic descriptors I need.  So far, I've only used one generic
descriptor: metamethod.  This has been `discussed previously`_, I used Phillip's implementation.

``aeve.util.microfailure``

microfailure is a homebrew version of twisted.python.failure.  I just use it to capture exceptions and pass
them along "safely" without ignoring them.  It's used by aeve.terminology.resfinder and aeve.compiler.core. 

``aeve.util.namemangling``

namemangling makes strings safe for python names/atributes by appending underscores and replacing unicode
with ascii.  This is so it doesn't clash with a keyword or builtin.  It will do substitution of particular
unicode characters such as u'N{DIVISION SIGN}' (aka รท) with pythonic ascii names like 'div'.  If it 
doesn't have a built-in translation it will use unicodedata.name, or at worst case, it will use the 
hex representation of the unichar.
