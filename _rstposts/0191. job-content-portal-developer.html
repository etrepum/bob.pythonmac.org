.. -*- mode: rst -*-

Our company, `Mochi Media LLC`_, is in need of a web developer to put together a content portal site (ideally with the `TurboGears`_ stack) on a contract basis.  Being located in the San Francisco bay area is a huge bonus, as is working knowledge of Macromedia Flash and JavaScript.

If you're interested, please contact us at: work@mochimedia.com

Please include relevant experience (especially high volume web development work) and some code samples (open source is best).
