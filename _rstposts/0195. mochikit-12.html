.. -*- mode: rst -*-

`MochiKit`_ 1.2 "the ocho" is now available [`download`_, `release announcement`_].

This release is the calm before the storm, it contains mostly bug fixes and minor functionality improvements -- but big things are coming soon.  We have a signal/slot dispatch mechanism, a script.aculo.us port, a new testing system, non-browser compatibility (SpiderMonkey, KJS, SpiderMonkey, Rhino) and a normalized event object all in the works which will be hitting the trunk soon.  For more information about the new features check out the `mailing list`_ and the `trac instance`_.
