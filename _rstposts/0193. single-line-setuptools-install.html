.. -*- mode: rst -*-

For those of you just starting out with `setuptools`_, here's a quick way to install it.  After running this, you'll have access to `easy_install`_ for all of your other installation needs::

    python -c "import urllib; urllib.main()" \
    http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py \
    | python - -U setuptools

Note that this will execute Python code from a remote host without any kind of authenticity check.  Use at your own risk.  Only tested on Mac OS X, FreeBSD, and Linux (with Python 2.3 and 2.4).
