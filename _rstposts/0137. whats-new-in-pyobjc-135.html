title: What's new in PyObjC 1.3.5?
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

- Importing objc now ensures that Foundation is multi-threaded, previously
  it only ensured that Python was.

- New ``objc.RegisterCFSignature`` used to register ``CFTypeRef``-like
  signatures with the runtime.

- ``PyObjCTools.Conversion`` functions now support all property list
  types with the following conversions:

  - NSData <-> buffer
  - NSDecimalNumber <-> decimal.Decimal (if present)
  - NSDate <-> datetime.datetime

  New ``toPythonDecimal``, ``fromPythonDecimal`` functions which convert
  between NSDecimalNumber and decimal.Decimal using an intermediate string.

  New ``serializePropertyList`` and ``deserializePropertyList`` functions
  which serialize (Objective-C) property lists to and from NSData.

- ``OC_PythonObject``, the proxy for Python objects that do not have
  an Objective-C superclass and are not otherwise special-cased, now
  act slightly more like typical Objective-C objects (supporting
  ``-isEqual:``, ``-hash``, and ``-compare:``).  This allows them
  to work with Key-Value Coding if they are contained by an Objective-C
  object, among other things.
  
- New objc.signature decorator that allows easier specification of
  objc.selector wrappers for functions when using Python 2.4::

    @objc.signature('i@:if')
    def methodWithX_andY_(self, x, y):
        return 0

- ``PyObjCTools.KeyValueCoding.getKeyPath`` now supports all of the
  Array Operators supported by Mac OS X 10.4.

- Key-Value Coding of Python objects (whether or not using an Objective-C
  base class) should act like Objective-C now.  In previous versions
  there were inconsistencies with the use of capitalization, the
  underscore postfix in setters, and Key-Value Observing.

- The formal protocol list is now complete.  A new internal function, 
  ``objc.protocolsForProcess()`` enumerates over all mach
  headers and returns all of the protocols defined in the expected
  place.  This fixes the scenario where an application uses a
  protocol but does not define any classes that
  conform to that protocol (i.e. to check plugin conformity).
  Previously it was not possible to reach these protocols simply by
  walking over all of the classes.

- A special value, ``objc.NULL``, may now be passed in the place
  of 'in' and 'inout' arguments.  This tells the bridge to pass
  a NULL pointer to the Objective-C method, instead of a pointer
  to the value.  The return value will still be a tuple of the
  expected size.

- Some of the new Tiger frameworks now have wrappers:

  - ``AppleScriptKit``
  - ``Automator``
  - ``CoreData``
  - ``DiscRecording``
  - ``DiscRecordingUI``
  - ``OSAKit``
  - ``Quartz``
  - ``QTKit``
  - ``SyncServices``
  - ``XgridFoundation``

  Documentation and tests not yet written.

- New ``OutlineEditor`` example in ``Examples/CoreData``,
  it is a Python version of the identically named Apple example.

- The last argument of selectors that end with ':error:' is now
  assumed to be 'out' if its type is an object pointer.

- More conveniences for ``list``-like and ``dict``-like
  objects: ``__reversed__``, ``reverse``, ``pop``,
  ``remove``, ``fromkeys``.

- ``OC_PythonDictionary`` and ``OC_PythonArray`` now return
  ``NSNull`` to Objective-C callers as appropriate.

- New ``WebKitInterpreter`` example in ``Examples/Plugins``.
  Uses the new WebKit Cocoa plugin API available in Safari 1.3
  and later to embed a PyInterpreter in the browser.

- Fixed a ``CFBundleRef`` reference counting bug in
  ``Foundation._Foundation``.  The symptom of this is usually
  a crashing application after having loaded a PyObjC-based
  plugin into an otherwise Objective-C app.

- New ``PyObjCTools.AppHelper`` functions: ``callAfter`` and
  ``callLater``, conveniences for calling Python functions on
  the main thread as soon as possible, or after a delay.

- Twisted examples changed to use ``threadedselectreactor``
  instead of ``cfreactor``.  ``cfreactor`` is deprecated.
  Needs Twisted newer than 2.0 (svn r13575 or later).

- ``objc.inject`` now injects on main thread by default,
  and takes an optional third ``useMainThread`` argument
  to change this behavior.  This is a complete rewrite
  which should be correct, stable, Tiger compatible,
  and synchronized with mach_* 1.1.

- Removed an ``NSAutoreleasePool`` category hack that has
  been deprecated for quite some time.

- New ``objc.removeAutoreleasePool`` function that will remove
  PyObjC's global ``NSAutoreleasePool``, which may be useful
  for plugins.

- Fixed bug in the ``NSBundle`` hack that caused a ``NULL``
  pointer dereference if looking up a non-existent class using
  ``NSBundle`` API.

- Added ``OC_PythonUnicode`` and ``OC_PythonString`` classes that
  preserve the identity of ``str`` and ``unicode`` objects across
  the bridge.  The bridge for ``str`` now uses the default
  encoding of ``NSString``, rather than ``sys.getdefaultencoding()``
  from Python.  For Mac OS X, this is typically MacRoman.  The reason
  for this is that not all Python ``str`` instances could cross the
  bridge at all previously.  ``objc.setStrBridgeEnabled(False)`` will
  still trigger warnings, if you are attempting to track down an
  encoding bug.  However, the symptoms of the bug will be incorrectly
  encoded text, not an exception.

- New Xcode project template "PyObjC Mixed Application" that is
  a py2app based Python application that loads an Objective-C
  plug-in built as a separate target.

- New py2app based Xcode templates "PyObjC Application" and
  "PyObjC Document-based Application", these replace the
  older "Cocoa-Python Application" and 
  "Cocoa-Python Document-based Application" respectively.

- New ``InjectBrowser`` example in ``Examples/Inject`` that demonstrates
  injection of the ``ClassBrowser`` example into another application using
  ``objc.inject``.

- ``NSData`` and ``NSMutableData`` instances now support the Python buffer
  protocol.

- ``NSData`` instances now support a convenience API that allow them to
  act like a ``buffer`` instance for ``str()`` and slicing.

- Objects that support the Python buffer protocol, such as ``buffer`` and
  ``array.array`` (but not ``str`` or ``unicode``) are now bridged as
  ``NSData`` subclasses.
