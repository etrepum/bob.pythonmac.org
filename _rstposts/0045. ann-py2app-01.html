`py2app`_ is the bundlebuilder replacement we've all been waiting for.  It is implemented as a distutils command, similar to `py2exe`_.

Even at this early stage, it's probably the most advanced python packaging utility out there with regard to dependency analysis.  It's at a "works for me and the two other people that have tried it" stage.  It's not particularly documented, and I don't have time to document it today, but you should be able to get along given the examples.  Since it is very similar to `py2exe`_ in design, you can also borrow ideas from there.

If you have any issues with `py2app`_, please let me know.  Provide source if possible.  I'm particularly interested in problematic packages which use import tricks or in-package data files such as `PIL`_ or `pygame`_.  These two are explicitly supported by the extensible "recipe" mechanism of `py2app`_, but there are surely others.  I believe `PEAK`_, `ZConfig`_, `Twisted`_, etc. may do one or both of these things.  Until a recipe is created for a particular problematic package, you may always just include it wholesale with the -p argument.
