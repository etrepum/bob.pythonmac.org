I've done a bunch of work on `py2app`_ the past couple days.  It's probably in a state where it could be used for a legitimate project, but I'm not going to provide any real support it yet.  If you do play with it, you will need to also check out the latest `macholib`_.

New stuff:

* dylib dependency hunting and rewriting
* standalone (for non-vendor python builds)
* data resources
* icon
* template plist file, plistlib.Plist, or dict
* alias build mode (similar to but better than bundlebuilder --symlink)
* can avoid modulefinder (when using alias build mode)
* Python 2.4 support
* dylib/framework includes
* semi-standalone option when using non-system Python
* argv emulation
* chdir to Resources folder (or not)

Still missing:

* Non-zip distribution mode
* Plugins (preference panes, etc.)
* Including full packages
* Still haven't tried anything non-trivial
* dylib/framework excludes
* baked-in "recipes" for common problematic packages (PIL, for example)
* a couple minor bundlebuilder options (creator, bundle-id, strip)
