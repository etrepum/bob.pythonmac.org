title: MochiKit at the Ajax Experience
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

For all of you ajaxians out there, `The Ajax Experience`_ is coming up next month!  From the roster it looks like it's going to be quite the conference.  There are representatives speaking for quite a few of the ajax-related frameworks and libraries (including my `Intro to MochiKit`_), as well as the people responsible for JavaScript, JSON, and just about everything else a "web 2.0" developer should be intimately familiar with.

`The Ajax Experience`_ runs from May 10th-12th at the Westin St. Francis right here in rainy San Francisco.

For those of you not able to attend, I will definitely be making all of my presentation materials available after the talk, but I would highly recommend showing up if you can.  In my experience, the talks are the least interesting part of any conference.
