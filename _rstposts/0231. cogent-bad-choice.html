title: Cogent = Bad choice

.. -*- mode: rst -*-

So it seems that I made the wrong decision for our uplink at Mochi Media. We have a gigabit line to Cogent at 365 Main. They've been mostly good so far (and cheap), but their recent `spat with Telia`_ has cut us off to parts of Europe (at least Sweden and Denmark). Not cool.

Anyone have any recommendations on other providers we should talk to? I don't want us to be dependent on Cogent for a minute longer than we have to be.
