title: Round those corners with MochiKit.Visual

.. _`MochiKit`: http://mochikit.com/

`MochiKit`_ received its first "third party" contribution today: MochiKit.Visual.  `Kevin Dangoor`_ deserves some mad props for this!

Currently, the only spiffy thing MochiKit.Visual does is provide a method to round the corners of HTML elements (`demo`_).  Originally it was a port of the `Rico`_ code to do the same, but the `current implementation`_ bears little similarity to its ancestor.

.. _`Rico`: http://openrico.org/
.. _`current implementation`: http://mochikit.com/MochiKit/Visual.js

Three big things (read: almost everything) have changed from the `Rico`_ implementation:

- The API to round the corners of an element is a function, ``roundElement``.  Not some crazy construct-an-object-just-for-the-side-effects ``new RoundCorners``.  Man, some of the JavaScript out there (that people actually use!) should really be making more appearances on the `The Daily WTF`_.

- The ``Color`` object is no longer mutable.  Again, WTF?  I re-engineered the whole thing, so now it really bears more resemblence to AppKit's `NSColor`_.    Including the convenient ``Color.whiteColor()``, etc.  The Color object also supports a whole lot more stuff than the Rico version; it should be able to handle any color expression in CSS3 (including alpha support and HSL)!  Oh, and it has `tests`_, so you know it's not b0rked.

- `MochiKit.Visual has documentation`_.

Come on guys, JavaScript code is fugly.  Write some documentation already.  I think that if more people wrote docs, they'd realize how bad their APIs are.  We've got `plenty of docs`_.  In fact, we have *complete doc coverage*.  That's right, everything in MochiKit has documentation you can read without looking at the source!
