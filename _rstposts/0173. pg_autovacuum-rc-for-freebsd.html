title: pg_autovacuum rc for FreeBSD
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

/usr/ports/databases/postgresql-contrib comes with the very useful (until 8.1, anyway) pg_autovacuum daemon, but no rc script.  Here's one I whipped up:

``/usr/local/etc/rc.d/019.pg_autovacuum.sh``

.. pycode::

    #!/bin/sh
    #
    # PROVIDE: pg_autovacuum
    # REQUIRE: postgresql
    # KEYWORD: FreeBSD shutdown

    # Add the following line to /etc/rc.conf to enable `pg_autovacuum':
    #
    # pg_autovacuum_enable="YES"
    #
    #

    . /etc/rc.subr


    pg_autovacuum_enable=${pg_autovacuum_enable:-"NO"}
    pg_autovacuum_flags=${pg_autovacuum_flags:-"-v 300 -V 0.5"}

    name=pg_autovacuum
    rcvar=`set_rcvar`
    command=/usr/local/bin/pg_autovacuum
    load_rc_config ${name}
    command_args="-D ${pg_autovacuum_flags}"
    pg_autovacuum_user=pgsql

    run_rc_command "$1"

I did submit a PR with this by way of ``send-pr``, but it doesn't seem to have ended up in the PR repository.  I'm not sure what to do about that, as it's the recommended way to submit PRs!
