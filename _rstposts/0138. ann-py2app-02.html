.. -*- mode: rst -*-

`py2app 0.2`_ is a minor bug fix release.  You can download it from `pythonmac.org packages`_.  `PyObjC`_ 1.3.5 ships with py2app 0.2, so if you have that, you have already upgraded to py2app 0.2!

.. _`py2app 0.2`: http://undefined.org/python/#py2app
.. _`pythonmac.org packages`: http://pythonmac.org/packages/
.. _`PyObjC`: http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/

Functional changes:

- New datamodels option to support CoreData.  Compiles
  .xcdatamodel files and places them in the Resources dir
  (as .mom).

- New use-pythonpath option.  The py2app application bootstrap
  will no longer use entries from PYTHONPATH unless this option
  is used.

- py2app now persists information about the build environment
  (python version, executable, build style, etc.) in the
  Info.plist and will clean the executable before rebuilding
  if anything at all has changed.

- bdist_mpkg now builds packages with the full platform info,
  so that installing a package for one platform combination
  will not look like an upgrade to another platform combination.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a bug in standalone building, where a rebuild could
  cause an unlaunchable executable.

- Plugin bootstrap should compile/link correctly
  with gcc 4.

- Plugin bootstrap no longer sets PYTHONHOME and will
  restore PYTHONPATH after initialization.

- Plugin bootstrap swaps out thread state upon plug-in
  load if it is the first to initialize Python.  This
  fixes threading issues.
