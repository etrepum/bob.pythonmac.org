Mirroring of `Subversion`_ repositories isn't very well supported at this point.  It seems that the only way to do it without filesystem access to the server is with a perl package, `SVN::Mirror`_.

Installing `SVN::Mirror`_ was a bit troublesome.  Basically you need to:

- Install `Subversion`_ >= 1.0.4
- Install the `Subversion`_ Perl bindings (``make install-swig-pl``)
- Install `SVN::Simple`_ from CPAN (an unlisted dependency)
- Install `SVN::Mirror`_ from CPAN (say no if it asks you about VCP)

After that, you should have a `svm`_ utility, which you can mirror your repository with.  There is a documentation bug in the current version where it says that that ``init`` takes a ``skip_to`` argument.  It does not.  ``sync`` does, however.

In order to get the mirror going, you need to do something like this ::

  $ setenv SVMREPOS ~/svm
  $ svm init mirror/bob http://svn.red-bean.com/bob
  $ svm sync mirror/bob 2

The 2 is important, because it's the ``skip_to`` argument that allows your mirror's revisions to match your repository.  Don't ask.  In an earlier version of svm, this number used to be 3.

To check it out, you do::

    $ svn co file://$SVMREPOS/mirror/bob bob

And to update the mirror::

    $ svm sync mirror/bob
