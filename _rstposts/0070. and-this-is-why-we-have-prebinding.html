title: And this is why we have prebinding...

I thought it would be interesting to see some `Mach-O`_ dependency graphs, so I whipped up a quick Python script to generate `GraphViz`_ output using my `macholib`_ module.  These graphs are built using only the LC_LOAD_DYLIB command.  If I were to include the LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB command, they get a whole order of magnitude uglier.  Now you can see why it's a good idea to have lazy loading of symbols and prebinding, at least when you link to Foundation!

* `/usr/bin/python`_
* `/Applications/Mail.app/Contents/MacOS/Mail`_ (this is truly obscene, you have been warned)
