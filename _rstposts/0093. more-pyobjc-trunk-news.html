- ``PyObjCTools.AppHelper.runEventLoop()`` will now bring your
  application to the front at startup when using ``pdb``
  mode for convenience.

- ``objc.loadBundle()`` no longer filters the class list.  This
  solves a few potential issues and shaves off about 1/3rd of
  the overhead of ``python -c "import AppKit"``.

- ``PyObjCTools.AppHelper.runEventLoop()`` no longer breaks on
  pure Objective-C exceptions.  Most exceptions of this variety
  are more like warnings, and there is nothing that can be done
  them anyway.

- ``PyObjCTools.AppHelper.runEventLoop()`` now installs the
  interrupt handler and verbose exception logging when using pdb,
  either explicitly or by the ``USE_PDB`` environment variable.

I've also made some more progress on the (still marked NonFunctional) ``RemotePyInterpreter`` example.  It starts up and works, but stdin is not fully implemented and completion is not available.  As Cocoa expects completion to be synchronous, completion will be a little bit tricky to implement.  I'll probably have it return no completions, and then trigger a completion after the results are available (if they came back fast enough, I guess?).  After the interpreter is done, I'll see about writing a remote object browser (you can probably guess where this is eventually leading...).

After doing some optimization of PyObjC's initialization I started thinking about what else can be done to increase performance and offer more flexibility.  I think the key to this is making PyObjC as lazy as possible.  This might mean the return of an ``objc.runtime`` equivalent?  Also, I'm not so sure about creating all of these selector objects so eagerly.  Why bother?  ``pydoc`` support for Objective-C classes is basically worthless anyway because there are no doc strings.  I suppose we could have the dict-proxy object do the eager lookup if someone tries to iterate over it (more for code completion than ``pydoc``), but I don't see a good reason to bother until you *at least* poke the class.  This kind of laziness may also be the key to solving the infamous bug where you can't reasonably use a class method on a class that has an instance method of the same selector.  There is a way, but I think it might crash if the class and instance selectors have different type signatures (though this would be rare if it even exists).
