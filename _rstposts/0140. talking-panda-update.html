title: Talking Panda Update
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

We've (finally) updated `talkingpanda.com`_ today with a fresh new look and a new product: `iBar`_.

`iBar`_ turns your iPod (any iPod with a screen and a `dock connector`_) into an "ultimate bartending tool" with over a thousand drink recipes, mixing techniques, and even a couple history lessons.  Like any good bar should be, it's stocked.  Altogether, the Notes content adds up to over 3 megabytes (yes, that's text!) with more than 40 minutes of original, professionally recorded, audio.

Like its sibling `iLingo`_, `iBar`_ ships with installers for Mac OS X and Windows XP/2000 (everywhere iTunes is supported) that make installation painless.

And for relevance, here's a little bit about how it's all put together:

* The Mac OS X installer was developed with `Python`_ 2.3, `PyObjC`_ 1.2, and bundled up with `py2app`_.

* The Win32 installer was developed with `Python`_ 2.4, `win32all`_, `Tkinter`_, `PIL`_ and is bundled up with `py2exe`_ and then made self-contained with `NSIS`_.

* The build scripts for the installer application actually use *even more* open source stuff.  We use `JExcelAPI`_ to convert Excel spreadsheets to XML, and `Win32::Exe`_ to swap out the ICO resource out of win32 executables -- but no Java or Perl makes it into the redistributable :)

We're also blogging updates and podcasting some of our content, so point your `NetNewsWire`_ or `Safari RSS`_ over to `Talking Panda News`_!
