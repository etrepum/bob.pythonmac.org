UPDATE:
    There are more examples, and a real site for `MochiKit`_ now.  Check out `mochikit.com`_.

As some of you know, `MochiKit`_ is a badass lightweight JavaScript library that implements some very cool stuff.  We've been working on it from a `public subversion repository`_ (thanks `red-bean`_!) for some time now, but haven't had the time to finish the site or package up the distribution .  It's very close, and has been more than usable for weeks now.

If you're into edges and bleeding, check out: http://svn.red-bean.com/mochikit/trunk

There's currently exactly one example, `Sortable Tables from Scratch with MochiKit`_, which shows off just a smidge of what `MochiKit`_ makes easy.  The particular example follows the "unobtrusive javascript" buzz train and adds column sorting to a table that would otherwise display and look just fine if no JavaScript interpreter were available.

The `documentation`_ is really shaping up, but is completely unstyled at the moment, so shield your eyes for now.  The `reStructuredText documentation`_ might be more palatable in the interim.

Look out for `MochiKit`_'s imminent release here and on `JSAN`_!

If you want to see more of `MochiKit`_ in action, check out its sugar daddy: `MochiBot`_.  `MochiBot`_ is a tricked out traffic monitoring system for Flash content (that *really* shines if you're doing a viral campaign or want to watch your game spread over the internet).  If you're a Flash developer, you ought to find `MochiBot`_ pretty damn cool, and this is just the beginning of many services we're working on at `Mochi Media`_.  It's still beta, but it's free.  Free is good.

All of the tables in the `MochiBot`_ UI are sortable (when that makes sense) and are loaded on the fly by XMLHttpRequest.  This makes the interface just about as responsive as it gets for a browser, and you can refresh the data in a fraction of a second if you just can't wait to see how your Flash content is doing.  There's even some cute little sparklines on the dashboard!
