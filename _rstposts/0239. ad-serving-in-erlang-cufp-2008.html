title: Ad Serving in Erlang @ CUFP 2008

.. -*- mode: rst -*-

Slides from my Ad Serving in Erlang talk at `CUFP 2008`_ are available here: http://undefined.org/cufp2008/

I had a great time at `ICFP`_ and `CUFP`_ and it was really inspiring to see what other people are doing with functional programming. I look forward to attending in the future! I think I'll have to write an app in `Haskell`_ first though, so I can understand more of the `ICFP`_ talks ;)

If you're interested in `Erlang`_ I also recommend that you check out my `other erlang posts`_ particularly the video and slides from my `Exploring Erlang @ C4[1]`_ talk!
