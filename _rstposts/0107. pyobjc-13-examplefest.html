.. -*- mode: rst -*-

Lots of new `PyObjC`_ examples made their way to svn this week:

- New IDNSnitch example in Inject that demonstrates how to
  monitor for the launch of another application,
  use ``objc.inject`` to load code into a target process,
  and override the implementation of an existing method but still
  call back into the original implementation (method swizzling).
  
- ``objc.IMP`` should do the right thing now.  This type is returned
  by ``+[NSObject methodForSelector:]`` and 
  ``+[NSObject instanceMethodForSelector:]``

- New ToDos example in CocoaBindings that demonstrates how to use
  two array controllers for the same data, and how to use value
  transformers to alter the color of text.  Originally from
  "Cocoa Bindings Examples and Hints", converted to PyObjC by u.fiedler.

- New Bookmarks example in CocoaBindings that demonstrates how to
  subclass ``NSArrayController`` to implement the ``NSTableView``
  delegate drag and drop protocol, including copying of objects between
  documents and accepting URL drops from other applications.  Also
  demonstrates re-ordering of the content array.  Originally from
  "Cocoa Bindings Examples and Hints", converted to PyObjC by u.fiedler.

- New FilteringController example in CocoaBindings that demonstrates
  how to subclass ``NSArrayController`` to implement filtering
  of a ``NSTableView``.  Also demonstrates the use of indexed accessors.
  Originally from "Cocoa Bindings Examples and Hints", converted to PyObjC
  by u.fiedler.
  
- New ControlledPreferences example in CocoaBindings that demonstrates
  how to use Cocoa Bindings to simplify storing and retrieving user
  preferences.  Originally from "Cocoa Bindings Examples and Hints",
  converted to PyObjC by u.fiedler.
