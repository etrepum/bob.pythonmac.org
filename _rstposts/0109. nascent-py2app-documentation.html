title: Nascent py2app documentation
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

I started on some `py2app documentation`_ (`rst`_) for the next release.  Take a look, suggestions and contributions are appreciated!

Note that the documentation corresponds to the current state of `svn trunk`_, links that point to versions of `py2app`_ not yet released will not work, etc.
