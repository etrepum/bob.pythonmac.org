`py2app`_ is the bundlebuilder replacement we've all been waiting for.  It is implemented as a distutils command, similar to `py2exe`_, that builds Mac OS X applications from Python scripts, extensions, and related data files.  It tries very hard to include all dependencies it can find so that your application can be distributed standalone, as Mac OS X applications should be.

`py2app`_ 0.1.4 is a refactoring and new features release:

 * ``altgraph``, my fork of Istvan Albert's `graphlib`_, is now part of the distribution
 * ``py2app.modulegraph`` has been refactored to use ``altgraph``
 * `py2app`_ can now create `GraphViz`_ DOT graphs with the ``-g`` option (`TinyTinyEdit example`_)
 * Moved the filter stack into ``py2app.modulegraph``
 * Fixed a bug that may have been in 0.1.2 where explicitly included packages would not be scanned by ``macholib``
 * ``py2app.apptemplate`` now contains a stripped down ``site`` module as opposed to a ``sitecustomize``
 * Alias builds are now the only ones that contain the system and user ``site-packages`` directory in ``sys.path``
 * The ``pydoc`` recipe has been beefed up to also exclude ``BaseHTTPServer``, etc.
 * The ``altgraph`` from 0.1.3 had a pretty nasty bug in it that prevented filtering from working properly, so I fixed it and bumped to 0.1.4.

Known issues:
 
 * Commands marked with XXX in the help are not implemented
 * Includes *all* files from packages, it should be smart enough to strip unused .py/.pyc/.pyo files (to save space, depending on which optimization flag is used)
 * ``macholib`` should be refactored to use ``altgraph``
 * ``py2app.build_app`` and ``py2app.modulegraph`` should be refactored to search for dependencies on a per-application basis
