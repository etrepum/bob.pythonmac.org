title: Using .pth files for Python development
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

Python's `site`_ module is responsible for setting up the interpreter's environment
upon startup.  One of the things it does during startup is scan your site directories (typically just ``site-packages``, but framework builds for Mac OS X have an additional undocumented default location) for
``.pth`` files.  ``.pth`` files are used to add additional locations ``sys.path``, and
they are typically created by `distutils`_ setup scripts that use the (still undocumented)
``extra_path`` argument.

``.pth`` files are a great alternative to using the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable:

- You don't have to screw with your environment (which can be difficult on Mac OS X
  and Windows).
- The effect is localized to a particular Python installation.
- You can toggle their usage simply by moving them around on the filesystem.

They become especially useful when using a framework build of Python, such as the one that
ships with Mac OS X 10.3, because ``~/Library/Python/2.3/site-packages/`` is added to your
path (undocumented), so they become a vector for simply and easily "installing" packages
without authentication or administrator access -- perfect for development.

For pure Python ("purelib" in `distutils`_ terminology) packages, I create a ``.pth`` file
that points straight at the source directory, which means I don't have to bother with the
`distutils`_ setup script when I modify the code.  For example, I have two of these on this
machine:

**py2app.pth**

.. pycode::

    # /Users/bob/src/py2app is a svn checkout of:
    #     https://svn.red-bean.com/bob/py2app/trunk
    #
    /Users/bob/src/py2app/src

**docutils.pth**

.. pycode::

    # /Users/bob/src/docutils is a cvs checkout of:
    #     :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/docutils
    #
    /Users/bob/src/docutils

For Python packages that require extensions ("platlib" in `distutils`_ terminology), I create
a ``.pth`` file that points to the "temporary" build directory created by ``python setup.py build``:

**PyObjC.pth**

.. pycode::

    # /Users/bob/src/pyobjc is a svn checkout of:
    #     https://svn.red-bean.com/pyobjc/trunk/pyobjc
    #
    /Users/bob/src/pyobjc/build/lib.darwin-7.7.0-Power_Macintosh-2.3

**ctypes.pth**

.. pycode::

    # /Users/bob/src/ctypes is a cvs checkout of:
    #    :ext:etrepum@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ctypes
    /Users/bob/src/ctypes/build/lib.darwin-7.7.0-Power_Macintosh-2.3

This is somewhat inconvenient because:

- I have to run setup whenever I change the source (I'd have to do that anyway...)
- The build directory includes specific version information about the OS that changes on many Software Updates
  (these don't happen too often, so it's not such a big deal).

These can both be fixed, of course, with additional hacks - but I like to use as few hacks as possible
so that my development environment is easily reproducible.

There are two features I wish that the `site`_ module had:

- Tilde expansion in ``.pth`` paths (e.g. ``~/src/py2app/src``, or to implement home-dir-site-packages on other platforms - assuming the next feature)
- Promoting ``.pth`` paths to become site directories of their own (so that they are scanned for additional ``.pth`` files)

Both of these can be hacked in with another undocumented feature: you can cause arbitrary code to be run during this
process if the line starts with an ``import`` statement.  Due to the way it's implemented, you can run arbitrary code in one of two ways (the second way requires two files):

**hack1.pth**

.. pycode::

    # The module imported is not important, it's used only to 
    # trigger the execution of the following line.
    import sys; print "hack1 installed!"

**hack2.pth**

.. pycode::

    # This simply uses an additional module that implements the hack.
    # It's probably "preferable" to ``hack1.pth`` as it doesn't depend
    # on side-effects of the implementation.  The feature isn't
    # documented anyway, so you may be on your own anyway...
    import hack2

**hack2.py**

.. pycode::

    print "hack2 installed"
