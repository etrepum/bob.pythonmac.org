title: New PyObjC Protocols
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

`PyObjC`_ now (in svn) has a new protocol that makes it significantly easier to handle the special cases of Python -> Objective-C bridging:

- The Python to Objective-C bridge now looks for a ``__pyobjc_object__``
  attribute to get a PyObjC object from a Python object.

Although the news item is short, it has far-reaching implications.  I'm pretty certain that I've been able to remove hundreds of lines of code in just ``NSNumber`` support with this generalization:

- ``NSNumber`` instances are bridged to a ``float``, ``long``, or ``int``
  subclass that uses ``__pyobjc_object__``.  ``NSDecimalNumber`` is bridged
  to ``Foundation.NSDecimal``, which now supports ``__pyobjc_object__``.
  This eliminates a HUGE amount of cruft in ``objc._conveniences``.

Speaking of protocols, I also added support so that the formal ones work!

- PyObjC classes can now declare that they implement formal protocols,
  for example:

.. pycode::

    import objc
    from Foundation import *
    class MyLockingClass(NSObject, objc.protocolNamed('NSLocking')):
        # implementation
        pass

There's still a lot of room for improvement in the ``Protocol`` support:

- Protocols are not type checked.  Anything in the base list that is a ``PyObjCObject`` will get chunked into the protocol list.  Will probably crash if you do something really stupid (though there's plenty of that in `PyObjC`_ anyway)
- Protocols can not be created from `PyObjC`_
- selectors don't benefit from the Protocol information like they do for informal protocols
- `PyObjC`_ doesn't verify that you implement the protocol like it does for informal protocols
- ``objc.protocolNamed`` is probably pretty slow, should use a lookup hash

There's also a nice new convenience in ``PyObjCTools.KeyValueCoding``:

- PyObjCTools.KeyValueCoding has a new ``kvc`` class that allows
  Pythonic Key-Value Coding.

  - ``__getitem__`` is mapped to ``valueForKeyPath:``
  - ``__setitem__`` is mapped to ``setValue:forKeyPath:``
  - ``__getattr__`` is mapped to ``valueForKey:``
  - ``__setattr__`` is mapped to ``setValue:forKey:``

  The ``kvc`` class uses ``__pyobjc_object__``, so it may cross the bridge
  as the wrapped object.
