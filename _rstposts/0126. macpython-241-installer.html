title: MacPython 2.4.1 Installer
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

I've put together an "official unofficial" framework build distribution of Python 2.4.1 for Mac OS X 10.3 (and later, but that is not tested yet).  It is built using the same tools that Jack builds the official MacPython distribution with.

Unlike typical builds, this one has all the stock goodies:

- readline 5.0.005 (static)
- BerkeleyDB 4.3.27 (static)
- waste (static)
- Tcl/Tk Aqua 8.4.9 (dynamic - you'll need `TclTkAqua`_ to use Tkinter)

.. _`TclTkAqua`: http://tcltkaqua.sf.net/

Note that this WILL NOT work with Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) or earlier.  It is ONLY for Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and later.  That means, it *should* work on Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) .  Also note that it expects you to install to the root drive only, despite the fact that the installer doesn't force you to do this.

If you are using Mac OS X 10.3, it is recommended that you also get the `PantherPythonFix`_ if you have not already, to prevent conflicts with the stock Python when you build new extensions.  Packages for this Python will start popping up at `pythonmac.org packages`_ in the coming weeks.

If you are using Mac OS X 10.4, you should get the TigerPython24Fix package from `pythonmac.org packages`_.

And now what you're all waiting for, the download link.  It's here:
