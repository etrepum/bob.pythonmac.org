`py2app`_ is the bundlebuilder replacement we've all been waiting for.  It is implemented as a distutils command, similar to `py2exe`_, that builds Mac OS X applications from Python scripts, extensions, and related data files.  It tries very hard to include all dependencies it can find so that your application can be distributed standalone, as Mac OS X applications should be.

`py2app`_ 0.1.9 is included in the installer for `PyObjC`_ 1.3.  If you have installed `PyObjC`_ 1.3, then you already have `py2app`_ 0.1.9 installed.

py2app 0.1.9 is a minor bug fix release:

Bugs fixed:

- bdist_mpkg now builds zip files that are correctly unzipped
  by all known tools.
- The behavior of the bootstrap has changed slightly such that
  ``__file__`` should now point to your main script, rather than
  the bootstrap.  The main script has also moved to ``Resources``,
  from ``Resources/Python``, so that ``__file__`` relative resource
  paths should still work.
