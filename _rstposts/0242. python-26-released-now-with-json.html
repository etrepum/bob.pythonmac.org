title: Python 2.6 released, now with json! :)
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

`Python 2.6`_ was released yesterday, which has tons of `cool new features`_ including a new `json`_ library and a new `multiprocessing`_ library. The `json`_ library is basically `simplejson`_ (from a few months ago) minus the Python 2.4/2.5 support and refactored to take advantage of the latest future-compatible features (such as the new `str.format`_ method instead of using % format interpolation).

The only downside is that I wasn't able to get the latest `simplejson`_ 2.0.1 performance enhancements into the first release of `Python 2.6`_, but expect them for Python 2.6.1! Don't worry though, `simplejson`_ should install just fine with Python 2.6 if you need the speed. If not, you don't have any dependencies for JSON anymore, just change your imports::

    # Use simplejson or Python 2.6 json, prefer simplejson.
    try:
        import simplejson as json
    except ImportError:
        import json

    print repr(json.dumps({'key': 'serialize this!'}))
    print repr(json.loads('{"key": "deserialize this!"}'))

One of my favorite features in `json`_/`simplejson`_ is the shell command that will validate/pretty print JSON. Great for debugging, and it will be sweet to have it available on every box with Python 2.6+!

.. ::

    $ echo '{"json":"obj"}' | python-mjson.tool
    {
        "json": "obj"
    }

A really cool tip if you're using Mac OS X is that you can access the string version of the pasteboard from the shell with pbpaste and pbcopy. This will take the JSON from your pasteboard and replace it with a pretty-printed version! If you're using `simplejson`_ just change ``json.tool`` to ``simplejson.tool``. I'm sure this would be super handy in a text editor macro too::

    $ pbpaste | python -mjson.tool | pbcopy
