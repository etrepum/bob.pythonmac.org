title: Recent MochiKit commentary

.. -*- mode: rst -*-

For those not watching the entire blogosphere, here's two pretty good articles/posts about `MochiKit`_ that have come up recently:

`Andy`_ has put together `part 1`_ of a series of MochiKit tutorials for building a blog application, almost entirely client-side:

For a little more commentary on that post, you might look towards the `Ajaxian blog coverage`_.

`Jeff Shell`_ put out a little head-to-head between `MochiKit and Prototype`_ from a Zope user's perspective:

.. _`Jeff Shell`: http://griddlenoise.blogspot.com/

What Jeff doesn't seem to mention in his article is that his AJAX example actually shows Prototype and MochiKit living in harmony (using ``Element.show`` and ``Element.fade`` from Prototype, with MochiKit's AJAX support).  That actually *does* work.  Personally, I'd have demonstrated the AJAX stuff without the Fully.Qualified.Names in that scenario (to show MochiKit in its best light in comparison w/ Prototype), and used ``showElement`` instead of ``Element.show`` (saves a character, removes a Prototype dependency ;).

MochiKit plays very nice with both the strictest (i.e. `Dojo`_) and the loosest JavaScript development styles (i.e. Prototype) around, because it's very defensively programmed and well exercised in those scenarios.  There's one or two places in MochiKit where you pay a price (performance, or extraneous data carried around) if you mucked up ``Object.prototype``, but it actually does let you do that.

Thanks guys!
