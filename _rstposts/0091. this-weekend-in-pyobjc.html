title: This weekend in PyObjC
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

I've made several pretty cool enhancements to `PyObjC`_ and `py2app`_ this weekend:

- There is now a fast path for the ``NSString``/``unicode``
  bridge when ``Py_UNICODE_SIZE`` is 2.  This is the default
  setting for Python.

- The default selector signature will have a void return value
  unless a "return" statement with an argument is used in the
  bytecode.  In that case, it will default to an object return
  value.

This means that ``objc.accessor(...)`` isn't necessary for most setters!

- ``__bundle_hack__`` is no longer necessary, py2app now sets
  a different environment variable to the current plugin during
  execution, and a hack is installed to ``NSBundle`` so that classes
  may respond to requests for their bundle with the ``+bundleForClass``
  method.  The class builder adds a default implementation of this to
  Python classes if this environment variable is set.

- Added ``objc.currentBundle()``, which is equivalent to
  ``NSBundle.mainBundle()`` except after loading a plug-in.
  Makes it easier to load nib files.

- ``PyObjCTools.NibClassBuilder.extractClasses()`` now uses
  ``objc.currentBundle()`` instead of ``NSBundle.mainBundle()``.  This
  makes plugins less of a hassle to develop and allows identical code
  to be used for application or plugin development.

- ``objc.registerPlugin()`` and ``objc.pluginBundle()`` are now deprecated
  as they are no longer useful.

These all VASTLY improve support for plugins.  Additionally, I have made some changes to the `py2app`_ bootstrap to support these new features, and I've cleaned it up so that it loads plugins into their own modules rather than stuffing them into ``__main__``.

I have also started work on a new ``RemotePyInterpreter`` example, which runs the interpreter in a subprocess and communicates with it asynchronously.  This will be useful for IDE work when it's done.  The IPC protocol it uses is a cute little repr-based hack, loosely based on `py.execnet`_.  I'll also use this to implement out-of-process debugging (think ``pdb attach``) and other fun things, hopefully in the near future.
