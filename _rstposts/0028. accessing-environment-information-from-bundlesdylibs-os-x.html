The way that dylib works on OS X prevents you from directly referencing things defined in the executable from an external library (there are `kludge linker flags`_, but I don't recommend their usage).

The way to do it is to use crt_externs.h.  I didn't come up with this by the way, it's all over OS X (and NeXT, the header is from 1995) compatible software, such as Python and TCL (just `google for _NSGetEnviron`_).  You can even setup macros to make it feel like you have "unix-like" access to your environment, for example:

.. pycode::

    #if defined(__APPLE__)
    #include <crt_externs.h>
    #define environ (*_NSGetEnviron())
    #else
    extern char **environ;
    #endif /* __APPLE __ */

It seems that a few projects have tried to do this the wrong way, such as `4Suite`_.  They use one of the kludge linker flags and an extern pointer to environ, but that doesn't actually work because they missed a different kludge linker flag ;)  It may have worked under some conditions, such as with Apple's Python 2.2.0, but nobody should've been using that anyway.
