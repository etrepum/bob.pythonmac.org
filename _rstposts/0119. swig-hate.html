`SWIG`_ should definitely win the prize for worst implementation of a good idea, ever.  Automatic wrapping of code sounds great, right?  Well, it could be, but it's most certainly not.  To the point where I can only recommend `SWIG`_ to people that I really don't like.

Why must they break things in *EVERY SINGLE CONSECUTIVE RELEASE*?!  Do they hate us?  Are they secretly fighting to keep C as the first and foremost language in open source development?

I'm thankful that I have always had the common sense to avoid using `SWIG`_ for my own projects, but I've had more than my own share of headaches maintaining software that depends on the beast, like `PyOpenGL`_.  As you can probably guess, that's what I'm dealing with right now.  Although gouging my eyes out with a toothpick would be more pleasurable.  I hope the devleopers of SWIG don't put it on their resume, cause it sure wouldn't get them hired anywhere I work.
