Since the svnsync tool in `Subversion`_ 1.4 still lacks documentation, here's a quick example to get you started with it::

        $ svnadmin create svn.mochikit.com
        $ echo '#!/bin/sh' > svn.mochikit.com/hooks/pre-revprop-change
        $ chmod +x svn.mochikit.com/hooks/pre-revprop-change
        $ svnsync init file://$PWD/svn.mochikit.com http://svn.mochikit.com/
        $ svnsync sync file://$PWD/svn.mochikit.com

The example performs the following tasks:

* Creates a new local repository named ``svn.mochikit.com``
* Adds a trivial ``pre-revprop-change`` hook to the repository (required for svnsync)
* Initializes the ``svn.mochikit.com`` repository to be a mirror of http://svn.mochikit.com/
* Synchronizes the ``svn.mochikit.com`` repository with its initialized source

Note that this is point-in-time synchronization. To keep an up to date mirror you'll have to run ``svnsync sync`` on a regular basis (e.g. by cron job or post-commit hook).

If you're looking for an especially easy to install set of svn binaries for Mac OS X, I recommend `Martin Ott's`_ (of `SubEthaEdit`_ fame) build. I've been using it on all of my Macs for quite some time with no issues. Much less hassle than building it myself or using `MacPorts`_ (previously known as DarwinPorts).
