In some projects, like PyObjC, the coding style is to use tabs in C/Objective-C code, and spaces in Python.  I'm lazy, and haven't set it to do this on load, and I often forget to `:set noet` (not expand tabs) in vim.  The quick trick I use to convert tabs to spaces (or vice versa) is to:
 * set/unset `et` as appropriate
 * make sure my `sw` (shiftwidth) and `ts` (tabstop) are both 4 (this is in my .vimrc)
 * indent the block of code once (this converts, but gives me extra indent) with `>` in visual mode
 * dedent it with `<` in visual mode

Voila, the whole mess is now converted from tabs to spaces or vice versa.  Here's what I find to be comfortable in my `.vimrc` (I do have some custom stuff for python, pyrex, coloring, etc. but that's not as important)::

    set ffs=unix,dos,mac
    set ts=4
    set bs=2
    set et
    set sw=4
    set sm
    set sta
    set sts=4
    set ai
