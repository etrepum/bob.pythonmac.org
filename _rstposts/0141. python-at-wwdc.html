.. -*- mode: rst -*-

For those of you attending `WWDC 2005`_ next week, make sure to check out the Python related sessions:

602 A.M.P. on Mac OS X:
    `Tue, 9:00-10:30`_, North Beach

613 Python on Mac OS X:
    `Wed, 9:00-10:30`_, North Beach

Additionally, `Guido`_ is going to be speaking about Python at the `Wednesday Brown Bag Lunches With O'Reilly`_ (Wed, 12:45pm).

Oh, and if you're looking to complain about the lack of Python support (or public APIs so that third parties can do the hard work) in Xcode, here's where to express that opinion:

410 Developer Tools Feedback Forum:
    `Fri, 5:00-6:00`_, Russian Hill

There isn't a Python/PyObjC BOF arranged yet.  If you're interested in making that happen, find me after session 613 on Wednesday morning.  I don't really know the area, but `bbum`_ does (more than me, anyway), and he should be around at about the same time too.
