title: MochiKit Talk at Freedel 06
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

While I didn't personally attend `Freedel 06`_, I recently came across the slides for `Anant Narayanan`_'s  `Web Application Development`_ talk. Specifically it covers JavaScript web application development with `MochiKit`_ and `Dojo`_, and it's split into four sets of slides. I've just had a chance to give them a look and they're quite good.

The slides are all done with `S5`_, which is what I used for the `MochiKit Intro`_ talk I gave a few months ago.

`Part 1 - JavaScript`_:
    A general overview of JavaScript and AJAX

`Part 2 - MochiKit`_:
    An overview of what `MochiKit`_ is and why you'd want to use it. Lots of pointers to cool features such as `DOM`_ and `Signal`_.

`Part 3 - Dojo`_:
    Covers a bunch of the great functionality that `Dojo`_ has that isn't available anywhere else such as widgets, layout, animation, and offline storage.

`Part 4 - Case Studies`_:
    A few very short case studies of some JavaScript web applications.
