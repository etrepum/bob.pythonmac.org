title: pythonmac.org packages and missing extensions
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

The Python 2.3.0 distributed with Mac OS X 10.3 is missing three extensions typically found on other platforms::

    _bsddb
    _tkinter
    readline

Since these are part of the standard library, it is somewhat annoying to build them after the fact.  I have put together a little svn repository with the relevant setup scripts and sources:

http://svn.red-bean.com/bob/MacPythonPantherExtras/trunk/

Installer packages for these three extensions are available at:

http://pythonmac.org/packages/

Note that ``_bsddb`` and ``readline`` include their respective dependencies statically, where ``_tkinter`` requires `TclTkAqua`_ 8.4.

Many other packages are also available from this repository, including `PantherPythonFix`_, `wxPython`_, `Numeric`_ and `numarray`_ (with AltiVec support via Apple's `Accelerate`_ framework), `PIL`_ (with tiff, jpeg, and Tkinter support), and `matplotlib`_ (with Agg, wxPython, and Tkinter support contributed by Chris Barker).

The majority of these packages are only available for the Python 2.3.0 that ships with Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther), but a few are available for Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar).  These Jaguar packages are compatible with the `MacPython 2.3 distribution`_ (even if used on Mac OS X 10.3 or later).

Most of the packages in this repository were built with the `bdist_mpkg`_ command of `py2app`_.  Building your own redistributable package installers can be as easy as::

  bdist_mpkg setup.py --zipdist

The ``--zipdist`` option is currently only available in `py2app svn trunk`_, but will be part of the 0.1.8 release later this month.
