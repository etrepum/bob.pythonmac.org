2005-10-08      v0.90

- Fixed ISO compliance with toISODate
- Added missing operator.sub
- Placated Mozilla's strict warnings a bit
- Added JSON serialization and unserialization support to MochiKit.Base:
  serializeJSON, evalJSON, registerJSON.  This is very similar to the repr
  API.
- Fixed a bug in the script loader that failed in some scenarios when a script
  tag did not have a "src" attribute (thanks Ian!)
- Added new MochiKit.DOM createDOMFunc aliases: H1, H2, H3, BR, HR, TEXTAREA,
  P, FORM
- Use encodeURIComponent / decodeURIComponent for MochiKit.Base urlEncode
  and parseQueryString, when available.
