title: Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

.. -*- mode: rst -*-

According to `The Zen of Python`_ by Tim Peters:

    *Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!*

Apparently some of us weren't listening.  Both `WebWare`_ and `PyObjC`_ use several global names in the module namespace.  `PyObjC`_ has ``objc``, ``PyObjCTools``, and one per framework it wraps.  `WebWare`_ has a few of its own.  Unfortunately, `both have a package named WebKit`_!

Well, that sucks.  If either `WebWare`_ or `PyObjC`_ change, then existing applications will break.  If they don't, new applications that take advantage of both aren't possible.  Unfortunately, it's entirely reasonable to want to use both ``WebKit`` packages in the same application.  Oops!

Clearly, something ought to change, but I'm not sure what.  `PyObjC`_ can and probably should grow a namespace for its wrapped frameworks, but should `WebWare`_ also be "polluting" the global namespace?

Should `PyPI`_ grow a global registry for top level names, like Apple's `registry for creator codes`_?
