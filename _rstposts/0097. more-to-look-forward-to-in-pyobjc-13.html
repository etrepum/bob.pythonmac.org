title: More to look forward to in PyObjC 1.3
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

Lots of nice new things went into `PyObjC`_ the past few days:

- New HotKeyPython example in AppKit that demonstrates how to use
  Carbon global hot keys from a PyObjC application.  Also demonstrates
  how to use a NSApplication subclass.

- `Key-Value Observing`_ support is now automatic in Python classes that
  descend from ``NSObject``, unless they implement a custom
  ``willChangeValueForKey:``, ``didChangeValueForKey:``, or
  ``__useKVO__`` is not True.  This allows ``self.foo = 1`` to
  automatically trigger notifications.  This works in all cases,
  whether ``foo`` is a ``property``, ``ivar``, or just in the
  ``__dict__``.

This should make writing `Cocoa Bindings`_ applications a whole heck of a lot easier...

- New Inject folder in Examples, with a PyInterpreter
  example that will inject a GUI Python interpreter into any process.

- New ``objc.inject()`` function for Mac OS X 10.3 and later,
  allows an arbitrary bundle to be loaded into another process
  using `mach_inject`_.

``objc.inject()`` can be used to implement some really interesting things, such as a "pdb attach" into a separate process, or a "Python Anywhere" like `F-Script Anywhere`_.

- ``objc.classAddMethods`` now recognizes and supports
  classmethods.

- GC is now correctly implemented for struct wrappers.

- The ``NSNumber`` bridge has been removed, now you will get
  ``NSNumber`` instances across the bridge instead of a
  Python representation.

This allows you do use Objective-C conventions for dealing with numbers, i.e. ``someNumber.doubleValue()``.  The reason I did this was because ``NSNumber`` only keeps track of the "basic type" of the value that goes in, so it will "forget" if the value was unsigned.  Since Python is really bad at emulating C conventions for signed/unsigned numbers, this was the obvious way to fix it.
