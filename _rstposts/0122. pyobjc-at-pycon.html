.. -*- mode: rst -*-

I can finally take a breather now that my talks are over!  For those of you that missed them, or want to take a closer look, here are the slides:

- `Intro to PyObjC`_
- `PyObjC Hacking`_

.. _`Intro to PyObjC`: http://svn.red-bean.com/bob/pycon/2005/trunk/dist/PyObjC-Intro.pdf
.. _`PyObjC Hacking`: http://svn.red-bean.com/bob/pycon/2005/trunk/dist/PyObjC-Hacking.pdf

If you poke around in the svn repository that those link to, you can find the ReST source for the slides, the source imagery, the software that throws them together with `docutils`_ and `Reportlab`_, etc.
