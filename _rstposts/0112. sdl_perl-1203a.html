.. -*- mode: rst -*-

This is painfully old news, but it seems that `Tels`_ had forked `SDL_perl`_ and released `SDL_perl 1.20.3`_.  This distribution is a hybrid of SDL_perl 2.0b2, with a mostly compatible SDL_perl 1.19 interface.  `Thomas Tongue`_ forked this as `SDL_perl 1.20.3a`_ which integrates some of the Mac OS X build patches I had made when I ported `Frozen Bubble`_.

I say mostly compatible, because it almost works unchanged with `Frozen Bubble`_ (as far as I can tell).  It seems that SDL_perl 1.19 stored ``SDL::Surface`` objects as a hash reference, where they are scalar references in SDL_perl 1.20.3a.  So, I had to change several lines of code that looked like this::

    $surface_reference->{-surface}

To this::

    ${$surface_reference}
