title: simplejson 1.1
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

`simplejson`_ is a simple, fast, complete, correct and extensible `JSON`_ encoder/decoder for Python 2.3+.  It is pure Python code with no dependencies.  It's now the recommended module for Python use by `JSON.org`_ (replacing `json-py`_).

`simplejson`_ was previously named simple_json, but was renamed to comply with `PEP 8`_ module naming guidelines.

`simplejson`_ 1.1 has a much bigger test suite, a full set of `documentation`_ and a couple new features.

- The encoder and decoder have been extended to understand NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity (but this can be turned off via ``allow_nan=False`` for strict JSON compliance)
- The decoder's scanner has been fixed so that it no longer accepts invalid JSON documents
- The decoder now reports line and column information as well as character numbers for easier debugging
- The encoder now has a circular reference checker, which can be optionally disabled with ``check_circular=False``
- dump, dumps, load, loads now accept an optional ``cls`` kwarg to use an alternate JSONEncoder or JSONDecoder class for convenience.
- The read/write compatibility shim for `json-py`_ now have deprecation warnings
