title: Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger)'s copyfile()
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

All of the snazzy ACL-and-metadata-copying features in Darwin 8 / Tiger live in one function, ``copyfile()``.  Unfortunately, Apple forgot to include the header for it in the version of Xcode that ships with Mac OS X 10.4.

It is defined in libSystem, so you can use it if you knew its prototype, and you can pick up the `copyfile.h`_ (may not be newest!) from the Libc package from `Darwin releases`_.

.. _`copyfile.h`: http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.4/Libc-391/darwin/copyfile.h
.. _`Darwin releases`: http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/

Since this isn't a static library, and probably depends on New Stuff, using it in a backwards compatible way (i.e. to get resource-fork copying in Panther) probably isn't going to work.  Oh well.
