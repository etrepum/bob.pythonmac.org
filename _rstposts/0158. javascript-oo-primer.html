Prototypes
----------

JavaScript is a non-traditional Object Oriented language in that it uses
prototype based, rather than class based inheritance.  Some other languages
that implement prototype-based OO are Self, Lua, Io, NewtonScript, Slate,
and Prothon.

The basic premise of prototype-based OO is that new objects are created from
similar objects, much like using a copy machine.  The new object is largely
indistinguishable from the prototype used to create it.  It is possible
to modify the new object without affecting the prototype, and this
new object may be used as the prototype for other objects.

Functions
---------

In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects like any other.  They may be
stored in variables, passed as arguments, and properties may be added or
removed from them dynamically (e.g. ``func.foo = "bar"``).  Functions are
also the building block for creating new objects.  There are three different
syntaxes for invoking a function:

Function Call:
    ``func(a, b)``

    Execute the body of ``func`` with two arguments, ``a`` and ``b``, and the special
    ``this`` variable set to the global object (typically ``window`` in a browser).
    The value of this expression will be the value given by the terminal ``return``
    statement, or ``undefined`` if no ``return`` statement is reached before the
    execution completes.

    Note that even if ``func`` is a local variable in another function's scope,
    ``this`` will still be set to the global object!

Method Call:
    ``obj.func(a, b)``

    Execute the body of ``func`` with two arguments, ``a`` and ``b``, and special
    ``this`` variable set to ``obj``.  The value of this expression will be the
    value given by the terminal ``return`` statement, or ``undefined`` if no
    ``return`` statement is reached before the execution completes.

    Note that this is actually a different syntax entirely than the function call.
    ``func`` is not bound to ``obj`` in any way, and that a reference to ``func`` as
    a local variable or on another object will behave differently if called!

Constructor:
    ``new func(a, b)``

    Execute the body of ``func`` with two arguments, ``a`` and ``b``, and special
    ``this`` variable set to a new object (``newObject``) cloned from
    ``func.prototype``.  The value of this expression is always ``newObject``.  If
    any ``return`` statement is reached during execution, its value is ignored.

    The expression ``(newObject instanceof func)`` will evaluate to ``true`` so long
    as ``func.prototype`` is not replaced with another object.  Additionally,
    ``(newObject instanceof T)`` will evaluate to ``true`` for all values of ``T``
    where ``(func.prototype instanceof T)`` evalutes to ``true``.

    ``newObject`` is a copy-on-write clone of ``func.prototype``.  This means that
    any property set on ``newObject`` *will not* propagate to ``func.prototype``.
    Conversely, any property added or changed on ``func.prototype`` *will*
    propagate to ``newObject``, unless that property has been set on ``newObject``.

    All objects, including ``func.prototype``, have this prototype property
    delegation behavior.  This means that properties from ``func.prototype``'s
    prototype will propagate to ``newObject`` unless otherwise set by
    ``func.prototype`` or ``newObject``, and so on.  This prototype property
    delegation chain terminates with ``Object.prototype``, so properties set on
    ``Object.prototype`` are accessible (and enumerable) from every object in the
    whole interpreter!  Due to this, it's generally wise to avoid modifying
    ``Object.prototype`` (or really, any built-in prototype) whenever possible.

Demonstration
-------------

.. pycode::

    // set up the prototype
    func.prototype.protoProperty = 1;
    func.prototype.anotherProperty = 2;

    // create a new object from the prototype
    var newObject = new func(a, b);

    // the prototype's properties are visible on newObject
    assert( newObject.protoProperty == 1 );
    assert( newObject.anotherProperty == 2 );

    // newObject can be modified without affecting its prototype
    newObject.anotherProperty = 3;
    assert( newObject.anotherProperty == 3 );
    assert( func.prototype.anotherProperty == 2 );

    // func.prototype can be modified, and it will affect
    // newObject unless the modified properties were written to
    // in newObject
    func.prototype.protoProperty = 0;
    func.prototype.anotherProperty = 1;
    assert( newObject.protoProperty == 0 );
    assert( newObject.anotherProperty == 3 );
