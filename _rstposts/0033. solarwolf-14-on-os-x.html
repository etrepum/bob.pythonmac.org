title: SolarWolf 1.4 on OS X

I've packaged up Pete's latest version of `SolarWolf`_ for OS X.  It should work on 10.2 and 10.3 and should not have any external dependencies (even Python).  This version adds some new items, mines, and all new graphics.  It also seems like the starting position of your ship is less deterministic, but maybe I was just distracted by the new sprites :)

Until the SolarWolf page is updated: `SolarWolf-1.4.dmg`_ (4.3mb)
