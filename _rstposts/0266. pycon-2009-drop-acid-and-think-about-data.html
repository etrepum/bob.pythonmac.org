title: PyCon 2009, Drop ACID and think about data
---
.. -*- mode: rst -*-

I'm getting increasingly lazy about updating my blog these days, probably best to follow me on twitter: http://twitter.com/etrepum

Anyway, I gave a talk at `PyCon 2009`_ in Rosemont ("Chicago") last week called `Drop ACID and think about data`_. Basically it is a survey of some of the various kinds of non-traditional database technologies I've been looking at the past few years. Notable technologies NOT talked about are object databases and graph databases. \*UPDATE\* Video available here: http://blip.tv/file/1949416

Slides are on `BitBucket`_ for now: `Drop ACID and think about data`_

I'll be giving a (hopefully updated) version of this talk at `OpenSourceBridge`_, which is in Portland, OR June 17-19.

If you're interested in the content of this talk there is far more insightful information on `Jonathan Ellis' Programming Blog`_, one of the developers working on `Cassandra`_.
