<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>Ever want to use a mapping as a key in a dict or an element in a set?  Me too.  Unfortunately, Python doesn't have a built-in mapping type that satisfies this requirement.  Fortunately, it's simple to do it:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
try:
    frozenset
except NameError:
    from sets import ImmutableSet as frozenset

class frozendict(dict):
    __slots__ = ('_hash',)
    def __hash__(self):
        rval = getattr(self, '_hash', None)
        if rval is None:
            rval = self._hash = hash(frozenset(self.iteritems()))
        return rval
</pre>
<p>This implementation is for consenting adults only.  It's not actually immutable, so don't change it after you plan on needing it to be hashable.</p>
