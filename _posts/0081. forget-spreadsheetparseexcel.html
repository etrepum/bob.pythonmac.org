title: Forget Spreadsheet::ParseExcel!

<p>I've been working on some automation scripts to take data out of excel and do useful things with it, and I hit a big stumbling block with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Spreadsheet::ParseExcel</span></tt>.  Unicode SUCKS in Perl, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Spreadsheet::ParseExcel</span></tt> does nothing at all to help you with that.  Each cell gets its own encoding ('ucs2', '_native_' which I haven't seen, or it's simply undef.. which seems to be latin-1).  Anyway, it's completely bogus, so I started shopping around for another implementation.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://andykhan.com/">Andy Khan</a>'s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.andykhan.com/jexcelapi/index.html">JExcelApi</a> does the trick and is light-years more correct and faster than the alternatives I have tried (other than the time it takes a JVM to start).  Not only that, but <em>by default</em> the jar does exactly what I want it to do.  It gets the unicode right, and everything worked perfectly the first time.  My dealings with Excel files have been reduced to the following:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
java -jar -Djxl.encoding=latin1 jxl.jar -xml EXCELFILE.xls
</pre>
<p>And the Python code to parse the workbook xml document from jxl looks roughly like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from xml.dom import minidom

def parseDocRows(doc):
    for row in doc.getElementsByTagName(u'row'):
        rowdata = [
            u''.join([x.nodeValue for x in col.childNodes])
            for col in row.getElementsByTagName(u'col')]
        if rowdata:
            yield rowdata

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    for row in parseDocRows(minidom.parse(file(sys.argv[1]))):
        print row
</pre>
<p>Thanks!</p>
