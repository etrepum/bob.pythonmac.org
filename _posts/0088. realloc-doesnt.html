<p>Apparently, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.3.7/Libc-320.1.3/gen/malloc.c">Darwin's implementation</a> of <tt class="docutils literal">realloc</tt> never frees memory if you ask
for a smaller size.  <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/sf/1092502">Python</a>, and probably plenty of other software, assumes that
it does, because that's how it behaves on the other platforms (at least Linux and OpenBSD).  Oops!</p>
