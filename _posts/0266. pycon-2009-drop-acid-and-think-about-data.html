title: PyCon 2009, Drop ACID and think about data
---



<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>I'm getting increasingly lazy about updating my blog these days, probably best to follow me on twitter: <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/etrepum">http://twitter.com/etrepum</a></p>
<p>Anyway, I gave a talk at <a class="reference external" href="http://us.pycon.org/2009/conference/">PyCon 2009</a> in Rosemont (&quot;Chicago&quot;) last week called <a class="reference external" href="http://bitbucket.org/etrepum/drop_acid_pycon_2009/">Drop ACID and think about data</a>. Basically it is a survey of some of the various kinds of non-traditional database technologies I've been looking at the past few years. Notable technologies NOT talked about are object databases and graph databases. *UPDATE* Video available here: <a class="reference external" href="http://blip.tv/file/1949416">http://blip.tv/file/1949416</a></p>
<p>Slides are on <a class="reference external" href="http://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> for now: <a class="reference external" href="http://bitbucket.org/etrepum/drop_acid_pycon_2009/">Drop ACID and think about data</a></p>
<p>I'll be giving a (hopefully updated) version of this talk at <a class="reference external" href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">OpenSourceBridge</a>, which is in Portland, OR June 17-19.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the content of this talk there is far more insightful information on <a class="reference external" href="http://spyced.blogspot.com/">Jonathan Ellis' Programming Blog</a>, one of the developers working on <a class="reference external" href="http://incubator.apache.org/cassandra/">Cassandra</a>.</p>
