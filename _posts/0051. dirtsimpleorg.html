<p>PJE, the author of <a class="reference external" href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/">PEAK</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/PyProtocols.html">PyProtocols</a>, finally got around to starting a blog!  I definitely look forward to see what he has to say, I think that the blog will be a much better venue for his insights than article-sized emails to relatively obscure mailing lists :)</p>
