title: PyObjC at PyCon 2005
---



<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>I went ahead and submitted my two 30min proposals for PyCon 2005,
hopefully both will be accepted!</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://svn.red-bean.com/bob/pycon/2005/trunk/proposal/PyObjC_Intro-30min-2005.txt">Introduction to PyObjC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Introduction to PyObjC is a quick tour of PyObjC suitable for anyone with
Python experience looking to get their feet wet with Cocoa development
using their programming language of choice.  Prior Objective-C knowledge
or Interface Builder experience is not necessary.</blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://svn.red-bean.com/bob/pycon/2005/trunk/proposal/PyObjC_Hacking-30min-2005.txt">PyObjC Hacking</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
PyObjC Hacking is a quick tour of advanced uses for PyObjC and related
tools.  This talk is geared toward those who have a working knowledge
of PyObjC (or at least attended Introduction to PyObjC) and ideally
understand data structures at the C level.</blockquote>
