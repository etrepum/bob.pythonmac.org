<p>I started hacking on <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.red-bean.com/bob/py2app/trunk/">py2app</a> again, and it's to the point where it can build applications now.  What it does:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Uses a bootstrap executable (like the PyObjC Xcode template, unlike bundlebuilder).  It <em>does not</em> require a compiler to do this, it's precompiled with source included.</li>
<li>Finds Python dependencies and stuffs them into a zip in the application bundle (some.app/Contents/Resources/Python/site-packages.zip).  This is basically &quot;semi-standalone&quot; in bundlebuilder terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>What it doesn't do, yet:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Non-zip distribution mode</li>
<li>dylib dependency hunting and rewriting (bundlebuilder2 / macholib)</li>
<li>Standalone</li>
<li>Plugins (preference panes, etc.)</li>
<li>Haven't tried or tested including non-code resources or full packages</li>
<li>Haven't yet tried doing anything non-trivial</li>
<li>No way to avoid the modulefinder step (should have a way to manually specify dependencies)</li>
<li>Take a template plist or additional plist arguments</li>
</ul>
