<p>Slides from my Exploring Erlang talk today at <a class="reference external" href="http://c4.rentzsch.com/1/">C4[1]</a> are available here: <a class="reference external" href="http://undefined.org/c4-1/">http://undefined.org/c4-1/</a></p>
<p>Yes, it is definitely <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolcat">caturday</a>.</p>
<p>For those of you interested in learning more about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, I highly recommend buying <a class="reference external" href="http://armstrongonsoftware.blogspot.com/">Joe Armstrong</a>'s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/jaerlang/">Programming Erlang</a> and/or read his 2003 ph.d thesis, which is kinda similar in content to his book but is more technical and is freely available: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sics.se/~joe/thesis/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf">Making Reliable Distributed Systems in the Presence of Software Errors</a>. The thesis is a bit more dense, but it was what really made <a class="reference external" href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> &quot;click&quot; for me.</p>
<p>If you want to play with the examples, go to <a class="reference external" href="http://cean.process-one.net/download/">CEAN</a> and download &quot;Erlang/OTP Full (Standard)&quot; at the bottom for you version of Mac OS X and follow the &quot;How do I install CEAN to /usr/local/bin&quot; <a class="reference external" href="http://cean.process-one.net/faq/">FAQ entry</a>. Alternatively, if you want to wait longer, you could use <a class="reference external" href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> to download and compile it. Once you've got that set up just run <tt class="docutils literal">erl</tt> from the examples directory in the slides download and it <em>should</em> all work.</p>
