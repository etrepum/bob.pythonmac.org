title: Round those corners with MochiKit.Visual
---



<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://mochikit.com/">MochiKit</a> received its first &quot;third party&quot; contribution today: MochiKit.Visual.  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.blueskyonmars.com/">Kevin Dangoor</a> deserves some mad props for this!</p>
<p>Currently, the only spiffy thing MochiKit.Visual does is provide a method to round the corners of HTML elements (<a class="reference external" href="http://mochikit.com/examples/rounded_corners/index.html">demo</a>).  Originally it was a port of the <a class="reference external" href="http://openrico.org/">Rico</a> code to do the same, but the <a class="reference external" href="http://mochikit.com/MochiKit/Visual.js">current implementation</a> bears little similarity to its ancestor.</p>
<p>Three big things (read: almost everything) have changed from the <a class="reference external" href="http://openrico.org/">Rico</a> implementation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The API to round the corners of an element is a function, <tt class="docutils literal">roundElement</tt>.  Not some crazy construct-an-object-just-for-the-side-effects <tt class="docutils literal">new RoundCorners</tt>.  Man, some of the JavaScript out there (that people actually use!) should really be making more appearances on the <a class="reference external" href="http://thedailywtf.com/">The Daily WTF</a>.</li>
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal">Color</tt> object is no longer mutable.  Again, WTF?  I re-engineered the whole thing, so now it really bears more resemblence to AppKit's <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/ObjC_classic/Classes/NSColor.html">NSColor</a>.    Including the convenient <tt class="docutils literal">Color.whiteColor()</tt>, etc.  The Color object also supports a whole lot more stuff than the Rico version; it should be able to handle any color expression in CSS3 (including alpha support and HSL)!  Oh, and it has <a class="reference external" href="http://mochikit.com/tests/test_MochiKit-Visual.html">tests</a>, so you know it's not b0rked.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://mochikit.com/doc/html/MochiKit/Visual.html">MochiKit.Visual has documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Come on guys, JavaScript code is fugly.  Write some documentation already.  I think that if more people wrote docs, they'd realize how bad their APIs are.  We've got <a class="reference external" href="http://mochikit.com/doc/html/MochiKit/">plenty of docs</a>.  In fact, we have <em>complete doc coverage</em>.  That's right, everything in MochiKit has documentation you can read without looking at the source!</p>
