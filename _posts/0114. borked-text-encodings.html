title: Borked Text Encodings

<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>Unfortunately when you're dealing with text across platforms, you're likely to run into a situation where you see characters that don't belong.  When I need to fixup such text, I put a snippet of the borked text on the clipboard and break open a Python interpreter.  On platforms other than Mac OS X, you'll probably have to fiddle around with the I/O boundary codecs, but on Mac OS X it is generally going to be UTF-8 to and from standard I/O.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys, codecs
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.stdout = codecs.getwriter('utf-8')(sys.stdout)
&gt;&gt;&gt; borked = 'CaliforniaÕs'.decode('utf-8')
&gt;&gt;&gt; borked
u'California\xd5s'
</pre>
<p>At this point we have the borked unicode text in a <tt class="docutils literal">unicode</tt> instance named <tt class="docutils literal">borked</tt>.  From there, I just guess at encode/decode pairs until I get sensible looking text without errors:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print borked.encode('latin-1').decode('utf-8')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in ?
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode bytes in position 10-11: invalid data
&gt;&gt;&gt; print borked.encode('macroman').decode('latin-1')
CaliforniaÍs
&gt;&gt;&gt; print borked.encode('latin-1').decode('macroman')
California’s
</pre>
<p>So apparently, this text originated in <tt class="docutils literal">macroman</tt> format, but ended up on a Windows machine and got marked as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">latin-1</span></tt>.  From here, I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to do this treatment in batch.</p>
<p>Are there any applications on the market that twiddle text encodings like this?  I've certainly run into the problem a number of times.  Would you pay for something that was really smart about guessing how to fix text encodings?  If it could do the fix for rich text documents?</p>
