<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.edgewall.com/products/trac/">Trac</a> is a &quot;minimal&quot; Subversion Frontend/Wiki/Issue Tracker/Task Manager/etc. written in Python that revolves around a Subversion repository and a SQLite database.  I've taken a quick glance (at the website and source code), and here are my thoughts:</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Verison Control!</li>
<li>Far, far, far less ugly than almost all of the others</li>
<li>It's not sitting on top of some monster like Zope/Plone/etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The source code mixes tabs and spaces (what the hell are they thinking)?</li>
<li>Lots of inline SQL code, no abstraction on top of SQLite.</li>
<li>It is based on CGIs, with no fcgi/asyncore/Twisted/etc integration that I can see, so it's not likely to scale and may have database locking issues (either corruption, or not scaling because the database is locked per-process).</li>
<li>The Wiki engine is based on MoinMoin syntax not reStructuredText, and it has no hooks to docutils.</li>
<li>When they say minimal, they were probably comparing themselves with Plone.  It certainly doesn't sound minimal from the description!</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, I think something like this is sorely needed, but it doesn't sound appealing enough just yet to compell me to dump roundup, MoinMoin, viewsvn, etc.</p>
