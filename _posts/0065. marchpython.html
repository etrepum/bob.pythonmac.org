<p><strong>24-Feb-04: Stackless Sprint in Berlin</strong></p>
<blockquote>
A sprint on Stackless Python will be done In Berlin, March 10-14. We are planning to work on auto-scheduling, more softswitching support, documentation, examples, Zope, refactoring Stackless into configurable layers, and more.</blockquote>
<p>I'll be flying out to participate, and hopefully also to meet up with the <a class="reference external" href="http://pythonmac.org/">MacPython</a> crew in Amsterdam for a few days.. followed immediately by a week of <a class="reference external" href="http://pycon.org/">PyCon</a>.</p>
