title: MacPython 2.4.1 Installer
---



<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>I've put together an &quot;official unofficial&quot; framework build distribution of Python 2.4.1 for Mac OS X 10.3 (and later, but that is not tested yet).  It is built using the same tools that Jack builds the official MacPython distribution with.</p>
<p>Unlike typical builds, this one has all the stock goodies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>readline 5.0.005 (static)</li>
<li>BerkeleyDB 4.3.27 (static)</li>
<li>waste (static)</li>
<li>Tcl/Tk Aqua 8.4.9 (dynamic - you'll need <a class="reference external" href="http://tcltkaqua.sf.net/">TclTkAqua</a> to use Tkinter)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this WILL NOT work with Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) or earlier.  It is ONLY for Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and later.  That means, it <em>should</em> work on Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) .  Also note that it expects you to install to the root drive only, despite the fact that the installer doesn't force you to do this.</p>
<p>If you are using Mac OS X 10.3, it is recommended that you also get the <a class="reference external" href="http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/02/04/fix-mac-os-x-103s-python-230/">PantherPythonFix</a> if you have not already, to prevent conflicts with the stock Python when you build new extensions.  Packages for this Python will start popping up at <a class="reference external" href="http://pythonmac.org/packages/">pythonmac.org packages</a> in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>If you are using Mac OS X 10.4, you should get the TigerPython24Fix package from <a class="reference external" href="http://pythonmac.org/packages/">pythonmac.org packages</a>.</p>
