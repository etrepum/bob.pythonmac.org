title: Versioned Frameworks Considered Harmful?
---



<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>It has recently <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a> come to my attention that using versioned frameworks without binary compatible APIs simply doesn't work all too well.  Essentially, you may have an older version installed, but without swapping symlinks around, you you won't be able to use the older version for anything except <em>runtime compatibility</em> with software that is <em>already linked</em>.</p>
<p>This isn't a problem with the dyld runtime, simply a problem with gcc's compiler and linker (and supposedly there may be runtime bugs with <tt class="docutils literal">CFBundle</tt> and/or <tt class="docutils literal">NSBundle</tt> in this arena as well).</p>
<p><strong>Frameworks</strong></p>
<p>Mac OS X frameworks are structured in such a way that allow for versioned code, data, and headers.  A typical multi-versioned framework looks something like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Foo.framework/
    Foo -&gt; Versions/Current/Foo
    Headers -&gt; Versions/Current/Headers
    Resources -&gt; Versions/Current/Resources
    Versions/
        Current -&gt; 2.0
        2.0/
            Foo
            Headers/
            Resources/
        1.0/
            Foo
            Headers/
            Resources/
</pre>
<p><strong>Mach-O, MH_DYLIB, and the dyld runtime</strong></p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">MH_DYLIB</tt> object file, the part that you link to, is &quot;Foo&quot;.  If this were not a framework, it would have the following layout, and it would be application-specific to put the headers and resources in the right place:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
libFoo.dylib -&gt; libFoo.2.0.dylib
libFoo.1.0.dylib
libFoo.2.0.dylib
</pre>
<p>Due to the way that <tt class="docutils literal">MH_DYLIB</tt> object files work, each of these dylibs know their own (supposed) location on the filesystem.  This is called the &quot;install name&quot; or the &quot;id&quot; of the dylib.  Technically, this is a <tt class="docutils literal">LC_ID_DYLIB</tt> load command in the Mach-O header.  When you create an Mach-O object file (executable, dylib, bundle, etc.) that depends on another, it will generate a load command (<tt class="docutils literal">LC_LOAD_DYLIB</tt>) referencing the other dylib.  The data associated with the <tt class="docutils literal">LC_LOAD_DYLIB</tt> is exactly the same data that was provided by the linked-to <tt class="docutils literal">MH_DYLIB</tt> in its <tt class="docutils literal">LC_ID_DYLIB</tt> load command, unless explicitly overrided with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-dylib_file</span></tt> option to <a class="reference external" href="x-man-page://1/ld">ld(1)</a> or rewritten post-link with a tool such as <a class="reference external" href="x-man-page://1/install_name_tool">install_name_tool(1)</a>.  The <a class="reference external" href="x-man-page://1/otool">otool(1)</a>  tool can be used to view these load commands in a Mach-O file, among other things.  It's very important to have these values set correctly because they are used by the dyld runtime to locate the intended <tt class="docutils literal">MH_DYLIB</tt>.</p>
<p><strong>gcc, ld, and frameworks</strong></p>
<p>Apple's GCC includes many changes to support Objective C/C++ and framework based development.  Unfortunately, none of them have any explicit support for versioned frameworks.  For example, <a class="reference external" href="x-man-page://1/gcc">gcc(1)</a> states that it uses the following algorithm for finding frameworks in headers:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
-Fdir
    In Apple's version of GCC only, add the directory dir to the head
    of the list of directories to be searched for frameworks.

    The framework search algorithm is, for an inclusion of
    &lt;Fmwk/Header.h&gt;, to look for files named path/Fmwk.framework/Head-
    ers/Header.h or path/Fmwk.framework/PrivateHeaders/Header.h where
    path includes /System/Library/Frameworks/ /Library/Frameworks/, and
    /Local/Library/Frameworks/, plus any additional paths specified by
    -F.

    All the -F options are also passed to the linker.
</pre>
<p><a class="reference external" href="x-man-page://1/ld">ld(1)</a> has an similar option, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-framework</span></tt>, which has a similar algorithm:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
-framework name[,suffix]
       Specifies a framework to link against.  Frameworks  are  dynamic
       shared  libraries,  but  they are stored in different locations,
       and therefore must be searched for differently. When this option
       is  specified,  ld  searches for framework `name.framework/name'
       first in any directories specified with the -F option,  then  in
       the  standard  framework  directories /Library/Frameworks, /Net-
       work/Library/Frameworks,  and  /System/Library/Frameworks.   The
       placement  of the -framework option is significant, as it deter-
       mines when and how the framework is searched.  If  the  optional
       suffix is specified the framework is first searched for the name
       with the suffix and then without.
</pre>
<p>Note that neither of these options allow for any consideration for the Versions directory in a framework, and therefore only link to whichever version was installed last, because the installation process for a framework will create the symlinks that point to locations inside the Versions directly.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, since there is no support or hook that will allow proper usage of versioned frameworks, the workarounds are all ugly.  I think the following workaround is the most appropriate: <em>Just Don't Use GCC's Search Algorithms</em>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Always use the compiler option <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-I/Path/To/Foo.framework/Versions/IntendedVersion/Headers</span></tt></li>
<li>use <tt class="docutils literal">#include &quot;Foo.h&quot;</tt> instead of <tt class="docutils literal">#include &lt;Foo/Foo.h&gt;</tt> in your sources</li>
<li>Always use the direct path to the <tt class="docutils literal">MH_DYLIB</tt> rather than any combination of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-framework</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-F</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Or, if you're building extension bundles that will be used by an executable that already has the correct version of Foo linked in, use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-undefined</span> dynamic_lookup</tt> linker option</li>
</ul>
<p>A minimal compiler/link line for an executable would look like the following:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
env MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.3 cc
    -I/Path/To/Foo.framework/Versions/IntendedVersion/Headers
    -o usesFoo
    usesFoo.m /Path/To/Foo.framework/IntendedVersion/Foo
</pre>
<p>And a minimal compiler/link line for an extension bundle would look like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
env MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.3 cc
    -I/Path/To/Foo.framework/Versions/IntendedVersion/Headers
    -o fooUsingExtension.bundle
    fooUsingExtension.m
    -bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup
</pre>
<p>Quite ugly, eh?  At least it works as intended.  Unfortunately you'll need to emulate enough of GCC's search algorithms to find the framework, which is probably quite problematic from Xcode, but shouldn't be too hard from say, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-distutils.html">distutils</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scons.org/">SCons</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">autoconf</a>, etc.  Note that you should also probably consider the <tt class="docutils literal">NEXT_ROOT</tt> environment variable when building against an SDK.</p>
