title: Creating standalone Mac OS X applications

<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://undefined.org/python/#py2app">py2app</a> 0.1.8 will ship with a new script: <tt class="docutils literal">macho_standalone</tt> (in svn already)</p>
<p>This script takes an application bundle as a parameter, and it does the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Scans every file in the application bundle for Mach-O files</li>
<li>Builds a dependency graph of every Mach-O file, copying in Mach-O files that are not part of the bundle already and not in a system location (<tt class="docutils literal">/System</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">/usr</tt> except for <tt class="docutils literal">/usr/local</tt>).  Frameworks are a special case, they are copied in wholesale and then also scanned for additional Mach-O files (plugins, etc.).</li>
<li>Normalizes the Mach-O headers to point to the right place.  Normally this means they will point to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;executable_path/../Frameworks</span></tt> style paths.</li>
<li>Strips everything</li>
</ul>
<p>The functionality in this script is used internally by <a class="reference external" href="http://undefined.org/python/#py2app">py2app</a>, with some additional special cases for frameworks.  However, this script could be used for applications not written in Python.. perhaps as an alternative to the &quot;copy files build phase&quot; for frameworks in Xcode, or as part of the build process for other <a class="reference external" href="http://undefined.org/python/#py2app">py2app</a>-like environments (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.fobj.com/rubycocoa/">RubyCocoa</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://camelbones.sourceforge.net/index.php">CamelBones</a>, etc.)</p>
<p>Of lesser interest is the new <tt class="docutils literal">macho_find</tt> script.  Like the <a class="reference external" href="x-man-page://1/find">find</a> tool, it walks files/directories and prints each on its own line to stdout.  <tt class="docutils literal">macho_find</tt> simply matches files that have the Mach-O signature, and could be used as input to a tool such as strip.</p>
