<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>This year is going to be huge for <a class="reference external" href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">PyObjC</a>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Apple is <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/descriptions/">paying attention</a>.</li>
<li>We're going to have 3 major releases in 6 months (1.2 was at the end of December, 1.3 final will be out this week, and 1.4 will be out by <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC 2005</a>)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Tiger</a>.  More frameworks, better existing frameworks.  Expect to see some Cool Stuff out of the box in <a class="reference external" href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">PyObjC</a> 1.4!</li>
</ul>
<p>I could say a lot more here, but I'm under NDA and I have a lot of code to write anyhow :)</p>
