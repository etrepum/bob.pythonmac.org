title: for loops and empty iterables

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://pythonmac.org/wiki/JustVanRossum">Just van Rossum</a> and I were discussing the <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/doc/current/ref/for.html">for:else:</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/doc/current/ref/while.html">while:else:</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/doc/current/ref/try.html">try:else:</a> syntax on the <a class="reference external" href="http://pythonmac.org/wiki/MacPythonChannel">MacPythonChannel</a> this morning (morning for me, at least).  I'm not sure if this is sufficiently covered elsewhere, but here is the pattern I use to check for empty iterables:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class NoValue:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;A unique placeholder, since None is sometimes used in iterables&quot;&quot;&quot;

def doesSomethingWithIterable(iterable):
    x = NoValue
    for x in iterable:
        pass # something useful could go here ;)
    else:
        if x is NoValue:
            pass # do something because iterable was empty
        else:
            pass # do something because iterable was not empty
</pre>
