<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>I can finally take a breather now that my talks are over!  For those of you that missed them, or want to take a closer look, here are the slides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://svn.red-bean.com/bob/pycon/2005/trunk/dist/PyObjC-Intro.pdf">Intro to PyObjC</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://svn.red-bean.com/bob/pycon/2005/trunk/dist/PyObjC-Hacking.pdf">PyObjC Hacking</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you poke around in the svn repository that those link to, you can find the ReST source for the slides, the source imagery, the software that throws them together with <a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sf.net/">docutils</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://reportlab.org/">Reportlab</a>, etc.</p>
