title: Apache X-Forwarded-For caveat
---



<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>When using Apache's mod_proxy in a reverse proxying scenario, usually you'll want to take a look at the (seemingly undocumented) X-Forwarded-For header.  This header contains <em>whatever the client sent for X-Forwarded-For</em> (if anything), plus the remote IP address of the client.</p>
<p>So, if you're trying to do anything with this header, check for commas and pick out the <em>last</em> piece, because the client can send anything they want to, and you shouldn't ever trust the client:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def get_request_ip(request):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;get the IP of a request in twisted.web-speak&quot;&quot;&quot;
    host = request.transport.getPeer().host
    # Twisted doesn't support IPv6 anyway :)
    if host != &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;:
        return host
    header = request.received_headers.get('x-forwarded-for', None)
    if header is None:
        return host
    return header.split(',')[-1].strip()
</pre>
<p>I gleaned this from reading the Apache 2.0.54 source, I couldn't find any description of the behavior of mod_proxy in Apache's docs, only how to configure it.  I was surprised that it even preserved what the client sent!</p>
