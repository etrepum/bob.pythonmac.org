title: Disabling a CPU with the CHUD framework
---



<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/macosxtools.html">Xcode Tools</a> has an optional component, <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/performance/">CHUD Tools</a> (Computer Hardware Understanding Development Tools), that consists of some useful performance tools and low-level hardware facilities.  My Dual 2ghz G5 has been having some serious stability problems lately, with what I believe is a dying CPU or logic board.  When I saw errant CPU messages in the system log after experiencing unexplicable kernel panics and crashes I decided to see what would happen if I toggled the second CPU off with the Hardware preference pane that ships with CHUD.  It worked!  My G5 is now usable (though I will of course still get it repaired, but it's not convenient to do so at this time).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I reboot the machine, this setting is lost and all bets are off as to whether I'll be able to disable the second CPU before the machine crashes, so I decided to look into what I could do.  I opened up the Hardware preference pane nib with Interface Builder to see what message was sent to change the CPU count (unsurprisingly, <tt class="docutils literal">setCPUCount:</tt>), then I used <a class="reference external" href="http://homepage.mac.com/nygard/Projects/">class-dump</a> to find the implementation address of that message.  I then did an <a class="reference external" href="x-man-page://1/otool">otool</a> disassembly of the Hardware preference pane (<tt class="docutils literal">otool <span class="pre">-tVv</span> ...</tt>) so that I could see what the code looked like at that address.  It called an unconspicuously named function <tt class="docutils literal">chudSetNumProcessors</tt> from the <tt class="docutils literal">CHUDCore.framework</tt> subframework of the umbrella <tt class="docutils literal">CHUD.framework</tt>, which happens to ship with <em>documented headers</em>!</p>
<p>At first, I tried writing a simple C program that naively called right into <tt class="docutils literal">chudSetNumProcessors</tt>, which returned an error code that I didn't expect (from the documentation): something about the kext not being loaded.  I knew the kext was indeed loaded, because the Hardware preference pane works and I've used <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/sharkoptimize.html">Shark</a> recently, so I looked at the headers for initialization functions.  Unsurprisingly, I needed to call <tt class="docutils literal">chudInitialize</tt> before trying to talk to the CHUD kext, so I ended up with the following program:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
/*
% cc -o setNumProcessors setNumProcessors.c -framework CHUD
*/

#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;CHUD/CHUD.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int rval = 0;
    int status = chudInitialize();
    if (status != chudSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;FATAL: Could not initialize chud, error %dn&quot;, chudInitialize());
        return -1;
    }
    if (argc == 2) {
        int cpuCount;
        int curCPUCount = chudProcessorCount();
        int physCPUCount = chudPhysicalProcessorCount();
        sscanf(argv[1], &quot;%d&quot;, &amp;cpuCount);
        if (cpuCount &lt; 1 || cpuCount &gt; physCPUCount) {
            fprintf(stderr, &quot;CPU count of %d not acceptable, expecting between 1 and %dn&quot;, cpuCount, physCPUCount);
            rval = -1;
        } else {
            int res;
            res = chudSetNumProcessors(cpuCount);
            if (res != chudSuccess) {
                fprintf(stderr, &quot;Could not change CPU count to %d, error %dn&quot;, cpuCount, res);
                rval = -1;
            }
        }
    } else if (argc &gt; 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;Must take zero or one argumentsn&quot;);
        rval = -1;
    }
    printf(&quot;CPU Count: %d of %dn&quot;, chudProcessorCount(), chudPhysicalProcessorCount());
    chudCleanup();
    return -1;
}
</pre>
<p>Now I can call this setNumProcessors application early on in the boot process and increase my odds of being able to use my computer on reboot!</p>
<p>UPDATE:  <a class="reference external" href="http://rentzsch.com/">rentzsch</a> commented with a better solution.  It's also possible to disable multiprocessing even earlier by twiddling a setting in Open Firmware (<a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1141.html">QA1141</a>).</p>
