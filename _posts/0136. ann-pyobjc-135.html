<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>PyObjC 1.3.5 is now available for download at <a class="reference external" href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<p>PyObjC is a bridge between Python and Objective-C.  It allows full
featured Cocoa applications to be written in pure Python.  It is also
easy to use other frameworks containing Objective-C class libraries
from Python and to mix in Objective-C, C and C++ source.</p>
<p>Python is a highly dynamic programming language with a shallow learning
curve.  It combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.</p>
<p>The installer package includes a number of Xcode templates
for easily creating new Cocoa-Python projects, as well as py2app,
a suite of tools for building redistributable Python applications
and plugins.</p>
<p>PyObjC also supports full introspection of Objective-C classes and
direct invocation of Objective-C APIs from the interactive interpreter.</p>
<p>PyObjC requires Mac OS X 10.2 or later and Python 2.3 or later.  PyObjC
works with the Apple provided Python installation in Mac OS X 10.3 (and later),
MacPython 2.3, and MacPython 2.4.</p>
<p>This release features several bugfixes, improved documentation, new Xcode
templates, Tiger support and many major enhancements.  See the news file at
<a class="reference external" href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/NEWS-1.3.5.txt">http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/NEWS-1.3.5.txt</a> for more information.</p>
<p>PyObjC is released with an open source license (MIT style).</p>
