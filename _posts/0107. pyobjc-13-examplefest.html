<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>Lots of new <a class="reference external" href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">PyObjC</a> examples made their way to svn this week:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>New IDNSnitch example in Inject that demonstrates how to
monitor for the launch of another application,
use <tt class="docutils literal">objc.inject</tt> to load code into a target process,
and override the implementation of an existing method but still
call back into the original implementation (method swizzling).</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">objc.IMP</tt> should do the right thing now.  This type is returned
by <tt class="docutils literal">+[NSObject methodForSelector:]</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">+[NSObject instanceMethodForSelector:]</tt></li>
<li>New ToDos example in CocoaBindings that demonstrates how to use
two array controllers for the same data, and how to use value
transformers to alter the color of text.  Originally from
&quot;Cocoa Bindings Examples and Hints&quot;, converted to PyObjC by u.fiedler.</li>
<li>New Bookmarks example in CocoaBindings that demonstrates how to
subclass <tt class="docutils literal">NSArrayController</tt> to implement the <tt class="docutils literal">NSTableView</tt>
delegate drag and drop protocol, including copying of objects between
documents and accepting URL drops from other applications.  Also
demonstrates re-ordering of the content array.  Originally from
&quot;Cocoa Bindings Examples and Hints&quot;, converted to PyObjC by u.fiedler.</li>
<li>New FilteringController example in CocoaBindings that demonstrates
how to subclass <tt class="docutils literal">NSArrayController</tt> to implement filtering
of a <tt class="docutils literal">NSTableView</tt>.  Also demonstrates the use of indexed accessors.
Originally from &quot;Cocoa Bindings Examples and Hints&quot;, converted to PyObjC
by u.fiedler.</li>
<li>New ControlledPreferences example in CocoaBindings that demonstrates
how to use Cocoa Bindings to simplify storing and retrieving user
preferences.  Originally from &quot;Cocoa Bindings Examples and Hints&quot;,
converted to PyObjC by u.fiedler.</li>
</ul>
