title: Cogent = Bad choice

<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>So it seems that I made the wrong decision for our uplink at Mochi Media. We have a gigabit line to Cogent at 365 Main. They've been mostly good so far (and cheap), but their recent <a class="reference external" href="http://gigaom.com/2008/03/14/the-telia-cogent-spat-could-ruin-web-for-many/">spat with Telia</a> has cut us off to parts of Europe (at least Sweden and Denmark). Not cool.</p>
<p>Anyone have any recommendations on other providers we should talk to? I don't want us to be dependent on Cogent for a minute longer than we have to be.</p>
