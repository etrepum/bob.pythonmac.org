<p>Worked on <a class="reference external" href="http://stackless.com/">Stackless</a> some more this weekend.  It should compile as <tt class="docutils literal">Stackless.framework</tt> on OS X now, so pretty soon (when it's stable and all) you will be able to have stackless and python installed at the same time without having to worry about version mismatch errors, DYLD environment variables, or whatever.</p>
