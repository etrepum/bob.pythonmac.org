<p>My first commercial consumer application, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.talkingpanda.com/">Talking Panda</a>, has just been released!  We offer a set of foreign language phrase books for iPods.</p>
<p>The installer is written in PyObjC, and I've described some of the development process in <a class="reference external" href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/pythonmac-sig/2004-June/011270.html">this pythonmac-sig message</a>.</p>
