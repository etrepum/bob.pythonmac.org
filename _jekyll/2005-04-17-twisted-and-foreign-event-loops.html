title: Twisted and foreign event loops

<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>There's a new reactor in <a class="reference external" href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a> svn: <tt class="docutils literal">threadedselectreactor</tt>.  This reactor blocks on <tt class="docutils literal">select()</tt> in a worker thread, so that it is easy to integrate with a foreign event loop without having to completely separate your Twisted code into its own thread.  This is awesome, and mostly eliminates the need to have specific reactors for each useful foreign event loop (<tt class="docutils literal">cfreactor</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">wxreactor</tt>, etc.).  Especially when the existing integration reactor sucks -- <tt class="docutils literal">wxreactor</tt> is more or less a worst-possible implementation, and the others aren't a whole lot better.</p>
<p>In order to integrate with foreign event loops, <tt class="docutils literal">threadedselectreactor</tt> sports an extension to the reactor interface: <tt class="docutils literal">interleave(waker)</tt>.  <tt class="docutils literal">waker</tt> is a callable that takes a callable as an argument.  Its job is to call this callable from the thread of the main event loop.  So, whatever you're integrating with needs to be able to send messages from an arbitrary thread to the main thread.  All of the event loops worth the fairy dust their bits are encoded on are designed to do this easily.</p>
<p>Other than that, the only other thing that needs to be considered is shutdown (if it matters to shut down cleanly).  To do that, you can simply replace your &quot;quit&quot; function with an implementation that:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sets up an &quot;after shutdown&quot; reactor system event that will call &quot;quitRightNow&quot; when the reactor is dead</li>
<li>Calls <tt class="docutils literal">reactor.stop()</tt> to commence the self destruct sequence</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://wxpython.org/">wxPython</a> already has <tt class="docutils literal">wxCallAfter</tt> that works perfectly well as the <tt class="docutils literal">waker</tt> argument for <tt class="docutils literal">interleave</tt>, so you can Twistify a <a class="reference external" href="http://wxpython.org/">wxPython</a> application in about six lines.  Here's a full demo: <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.twistedmatrix.com/cvs/*checkout*/trunk/doc/core/examples/threadedselect/wxdemo.py?root=Twisted">doc/examples/core/threadedselect/wxdemo.py</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">PyObjC</a> has a <tt class="docutils literal">PyObjCTools.AppHelper.callAfter</tt> that also serves as a too-trivial-to-be-true <tt class="docutils literal">waker</tt> (coincidence?  no -- I just added it).  You can check out the demo from: <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.twistedmatrix.com/cvs/trunk/doc/core/examples/threadedselect/Cocoa/SimpleWebClient/?root=Twisted">doc/examples/core/threadedselect/Cocoa/SimpleWebClient/</a>.  The examples in <a class="reference external" href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">PyObjC</a>'s <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.red-bean.com/pyobjc/trunk/pyobjc/Examples/Twisted/">Examples/Twisted/</a>  have also been refactored to use this (instead of <tt class="docutils literal">cfreactor</tt>, which should be considered dead weight).</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://pygame.org/">pygame</a> is more low-level and doesn't provide any conveniences beyond getting and posting events.  So your <tt class="docutils literal">waker</tt> should be some function that posts a <tt class="docutils literal">USEREVENT</tt> to <a class="reference external" href="http://pygame.org/">pygame</a>, which you need to pick up and do something with.  A minimal example of this is here: <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.twistedmatrix.com/cvs/*checkout*/trunk/doc/core/examples/threadedselect/pygamedemo.py?root=Twisted">doc/examples/core/threadedselect/pygamedemo.py</a>.</p>
<p>This reactor should trivially integrate with just about any event loop, including PyQt, GTK, etc.  However, the margins of my blog aren't big enough to fit them all.</p>
