title: How to patch Python's standard library without touching vendor files

<p>I've been using 2.3.0 for quite some time because it's the version Apple provides with OS X 10.3.  This works out just fine most of the time, even though 2.3.3 is the latest version.  However, it's definitely possible to hit a nasty stardard library bug or performance issue that has already been fixed.</p>
<p>For example, the <tt class="docutils literal">_strptime</tt> module in 2.3.0 didn't cache locale settings.  This misfeature makes it (in my experience) about 30 times slower than it should be (~20 dates/sec here); completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>Short of using <tt class="docutils literal">PYTHONPATH</tt> (a total kludge, IMHO), it's not obvious how one would go about overriding (without overwriting) bits of the standard library; site-packages and any pth files are appended to <tt class="docutils literal">sys.path</tt> long afterwards.  Fortunately, someone already thought of this and placed an obscure feature into <tt class="docutils literal">site.py</tt>: pth files can import arbitrary python code!</p>
<p>So now all you have to do is create a folder for standard library fixes, a python module to inject it into <tt class="docutils literal">sys.path</tt>, and a pth file to make that happen whenever you start an interpreter.  Here's mine:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">/Library/Python/2.3/2.3_FIXES.pth</tt></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import _2_3_FIXES
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">/Library/Python/2.3/_2_3_FIXES.py</tt></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, &quot;/Library/Python/2.3_FIXES&quot;)
</pre>
<p>Now create <tt class="docutils literal">/Library/Python/2.3_FIXES</tt> and drop all the standard library updates you need right in there.  I suggest fetching <tt class="docutils literal">_strptime.py</tt> from 2.3.3 right away ;)</p>
