<p>For those of you just starting out with <a class="reference external" href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools">setuptools</a>, here's a quick way to install it.  After running this, you'll have access to <a class="reference external" href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall">easy_install</a> for all of your other installation needs:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python -c &quot;import urllib; urllib.main()&quot; \
http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py \
| python - -U setuptools
</pre>
<p>Note that this will execute Python code from a remote host without any kind of authenticity check.  Use at your own risk.  Only tested on Mac OS X, FreeBSD, and Linux (with Python 2.3 and 2.4).</p>
