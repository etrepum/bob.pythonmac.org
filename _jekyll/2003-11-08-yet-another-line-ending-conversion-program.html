title: Yet Another Line Ending Conversion Program

<p>This is what I've been using.. it's really simple, and should convert Win32, Mac, or Unix line endings to whatever your native line ending is.  A possible future optimization would be to use temp files instead, but they're annoying.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys, os, shutil
from cStringIO import StringIO

def tonative(fname):
    buff = StringIO()
    infile = file(fname, 'rU')
    infile.readline()
    infile.seek(0)
    if infile.newlines == os.linesep:
        return
    for line in infile:
        buff.write(line.strip() + os.linesep)
    infile.close()
    outfile = file(fname, 'wb')
    buff.seek(0)
    shutil.copyfileobj(buff, outfile)
    outfile.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for fname in sys.argv[1:]:
        tonative(fname)
