<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>A new <a class="reference external" href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">PyObjC</a> user has been going through the motions of translating several popular Objective-C <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaBindings/index.html">Cocoa Bindings</a> examples to <a class="reference external" href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">PyObjC</a>.  Unfortunately, due to our lack of documentation and existing examples on the subject, he has been having a bit of trouble with it .  Fortunately, the <a class="reference external" href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pyobjc-dev">pyobjc-dev</a> mailing list has come to the rescue to provide quick and accurate answers to his questions.</p>
<p>So far, he's put together three excellent examples and contributed them to us.  They're already in svn trunk and will be part of <a class="reference external" href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">PyObjC</a> 1.3:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">CurrencyConvBinding</p>
<p>A rewrite of CurrencyConverter using Cocoa Bindings.</p>
<p>Originally from
<a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CurrencyConverterBindings/index.html">Introduction to Developing Cocoa Applications Using Bindings</a>,
converted to PyObjC by u.fiedler.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">ManualBindings</p>
<p>A simple example that illustrates establishing bindings
programmatically, including a number of options such as validation
and an array operator, and indexed accessor methods. A custom model
object implements custom validation method.</p>
<p>Originally from <a class="reference external" href="http://homepage.mac.com/mmalc/CocoaExamples/controllers.html">Cocoa Bindings Examples and Hints</a>,
converted to PyObjC by u.fiedler.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">TemperatureTransformer</p>
<p>An example that uses <tt class="docutils literal">NSValueTransformer</tt> to convert between Celsius
and Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Based on Apple's <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ValueTransformers/index.html">Value Transformers</a> documentation,
converted to PyObjC by u.fiedler.</p>
</li>
</ul>
