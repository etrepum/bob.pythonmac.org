title: Five-minute Multimethods In Python (using dispatch)

<p>While <a class="reference external" href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/PyProtocols.html">PyProtocols</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/CombiningResults">dispatch</a> more or less implements multimethods out of the box, I thought it would probably be useful to demonstrate that Guido's implementation of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=101605">Five-minute Multimethods in Python</a> can be cloned using it.</p>

        for i, typ in enumerate(args):
            yield Argument(i), typ

<p>Note that it would be slightly less code if the type arguments were allowed to use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">isinstance(...)</span></tt>, because that's what dispatch wants to do, but I wanted to clone Guido's implementation such that the class of the argument must be equal to the given type.</p>
<p>The other differences from Guido's implementation are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>No global registry, the registry is the func globals (could be extended to also look in locals).. so you could use this from multiple modules and not have to worry about having a flat namespace for multimethod names in your interpreter!</li>
<li>If you use default arguments, it's going to use the defaults specified on the first multimethod</li>
<li>You don't have to specify the type of every argument, you could multimethod dispatch on the first argument, or even named arguments</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that would likely be more sensible and less code to use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">isinstance(...)</span></tt> style multimethod dispatch instead, but I just wanted to make sure that the (weird?) semantics were preserved.  I'm guessing he used type identity because you could dispatch on a <tt class="docutils literal">dict</tt>, so the implementation would be short :)</p>
<p>The following is a more &quot;natural&quot; implementation of how this would be implemented using PyProtocols dispatch.  This version <em>will</em> accept subclasses, and can not be stacked.  Its syntax is not as terse as <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;multimethod</tt>, but it's far more useful as you can dispatch on expressions, not just type.</p>

import dispatch

&#64;dispatch.generic()
def foo(a, b):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    foo is a generic method that takes two
    parameters and dispatches based on type
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

&#64;foo.when(&quot;isinstance(a, int) and isinstance(b, int)&quot;)
def foo(a, b):
    print &quot;code for two ints&quot;

&#64;foo.when(&quot;isinstance(a, float) and isinstance(b, float)&quot;)

    print &quot;code for two floats&quot;

&#64;foo.when(
    # note that you can't use multi-line strings
    # in here without backslash continuation.
    # dispatch's current parser hates them(?!)
    &quot;(isinstance(a, str) and isinstance(b, str)) or &quot;
    &quot;(isinstance(a, unicode) and isinstance(b, unicode))&quot;)
def foo(a, b):
    # what makes this more interesting than dispatching on
    # basestring is that you can't mix str/unicode here.
    # also note that this is equivalent to stacking...
