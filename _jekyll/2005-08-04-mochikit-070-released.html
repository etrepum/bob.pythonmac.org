<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://mochikit.com/download.html">MochiKit 0.70</a> has been released!  This release includes a new example, a bunch of new features, a minor API change, and some bug fixes.</p>
<p>In addition to the new features, there's a spiffy new example: <a class="reference external" href="http://mochikit.com/examples/ajax_tables/index.html">Ajax Tables</a>, which is an extension of the <a class="reference external" href="http://mochikit.com/examples/sortable_tables/index.html">Sortable Tables from Scratch</a> example that loads data with XMLHttpRequest (in either <a class="reference external" href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> or XML format!).</p>
<p>Thanks to some help from <a class="reference external" href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/">Alex Russell</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://mochikit.com/">MochiKit</a> is now packed by the custom <a class="reference external" href="http://mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a> interpreter from <a class="reference external" href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo Toolkit</a> (though I wouldn't have needed help if it were documented ;).  Despite the new features, <tt class="docutils literal">packed/MochiKit/MochiKit.js</tt> is 33% smaller than the 0.60 release (chocolate rations are up to 72k from 108k this week)!</p>
<p>2005-08-04      v0.70</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>New ajax_tables example, which shows off XMLHttpRequest, ajax, json, and
a little TAL-ish DOM templating attribute language.</li>
<li>sendXMLHttpRequest and functions that use it (loadJSONDoc, etc.) no longer
ignore requests with status == 0, which seems to happen for cached or local
requests</li>
<li>Added sendXMLHttpRequest to MochiKit.Async.EXPORT, d'oh.</li>
<li>Changed scrapeText API to return a string by default.  This is API-breaking!
It was dumb to have the default return value be the form you almost never
want.  Sorry.</li>
<li>Added special form to swapDOM(dest, src).  If src is null, dest is removed
(where previously you'd likely get a DOM exception).</li>
<li>Added three new functions to MochiKit.Base for dealing with URL query
strings: urlEncode, queryString, parseQueryString</li>
<li>MochiKit.DOM.createDOM will now use attr[k] = v for all browsers if the name
starts with &quot;on&quot; (e.g. &quot;onclick&quot;).  If v is a string, it will set it to
new Function(v).</li>
<li>Another workaround for Internet &quot;worst browser ever&quot; Explorer's setAttribute
usage in MochiKit.DOM.createDOM (checked -&gt; defaultChecked).</li>
<li>Added UL, OL, LI convenience createDOM aliases to MochiKit.DOM</li>
<li>Packing is now done by Dojo's custom Rhino interpreter, so it's much smaller
now!</li>
</ul>
