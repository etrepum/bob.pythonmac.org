title: pg_autovacuum rc for FreeBSD

<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>/usr/ports/databases/postgresql-contrib comes with the very useful (until 8.1, anyway) pg_autovacuum daemon, but no rc script.  Here's one I whipped up:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">/usr/local/etc/rc.d/019.pg_autovacuum.sh</tt></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/bin/sh
#
# PROVIDE: pg_autovacuum
# REQUIRE: postgresql
# KEYWORD: FreeBSD shutdown

# Add the following line to /etc/rc.conf to enable `pg_autovacuum':
#
# pg_autovacuum_enable=&quot;YES&quot;
#
#

. /etc/rc.subr


pg_autovacuum_enable=${pg_autovacuum_enable:-&quot;NO&quot;}
pg_autovacuum_flags=${pg_autovacuum_flags:-&quot;-v 300 -V 0.5&quot;}

name=pg_autovacuum
rcvar=`set_rcvar`
command=/usr/local/bin/pg_autovacuum
load_rc_config ${name}
command_args=&quot;-D ${pg_autovacuum_flags}&quot;
pg_autovacuum_user=pgsql

run_rc_command &quot;$1&quot;
</pre>
<p>I did submit a PR with this by way of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">send-pr</span></tt>, but it doesn't seem to have ended up in the PR repository.  I'm not sure what to do about that, as it's the recommended way to submit PRs!</p>
