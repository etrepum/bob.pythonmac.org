title: Using .pth files for Python development

<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>Python's <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-site.html">site</a> module is responsible for setting up the interpreter's environment
upon startup.  One of the things it does during startup is scan your site directories (typically just <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">site-packages</span></tt>, but framework builds for Mac OS X have an additional undocumented default location) for
<tt class="docutils literal">.pth</tt> files.  <tt class="docutils literal">.pth</tt> files are used to add additional locations <tt class="docutils literal">sys.path</tt>, and
they are typically created by <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-distutils.html">distutils</a> setup scripts that use the (still undocumented)
<tt class="docutils literal">extra_path</tt> argument.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">.pth</tt> files are a great alternative to using the <tt class="docutils literal">PYTHONPATH</tt> environment variable:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You don't have to screw with your environment (which can be difficult on Mac OS X
and Windows).</li>
<li>The effect is localized to a particular Python installation.</li>
<li>You can toggle their usage simply by moving them around on the filesystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>They become especially useful when using a framework build of Python, such as the one that
ships with Mac OS X 10.3, because <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/Library/Python/2.3/site-packages/</span></tt> is added to your
path (undocumented), so they become a vector for simply and easily &quot;installing&quot; packages
without authentication or administrator access -- perfect for development.</p>
<p>For pure Python (&quot;purelib&quot; in <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-distutils.html">distutils</a> terminology) packages, I create a <tt class="docutils literal">.pth</tt> file
that points straight at the source directory, which means I don't have to bother with the
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-distutils.html">distutils</a> setup script when I modify the code.  For example, I have two of these on this
machine:</p>
<p><strong>py2app.pth</strong></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# /Users/bob/src/py2app is a svn checkout of:
#     https://svn.red-bean.com/bob/py2app/trunk
#
/Users/bob/src/py2app/src
</pre>
<p><strong>docutils.pth</strong></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# /Users/bob/src/docutils is a cvs checkout of:
#     :pserver:anonymous&#64;cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/docutils
#
/Users/bob/src/docutils
</pre>
<p>For Python packages that require extensions (&quot;platlib&quot; in <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-distutils.html">distutils</a> terminology), I create
a <tt class="docutils literal">.pth</tt> file that points to the &quot;temporary&quot; build directory created by <tt class="docutils literal">python setup.py build</tt>:</p>
<p><strong>PyObjC.pth</strong></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# /Users/bob/src/pyobjc is a svn checkout of:
#     https://svn.red-bean.com/pyobjc/trunk/pyobjc
#
/Users/bob/src/pyobjc/build/lib.darwin-7.7.0-Power_Macintosh-2.3
</pre>
<p><strong>ctypes.pth</strong></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# /Users/bob/src/ctypes is a cvs checkout of:
#    :ext:etrepum&#64;cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ctypes
/Users/bob/src/ctypes/build/lib.darwin-7.7.0-Power_Macintosh-2.3
</pre>
<p>This is somewhat inconvenient because:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I have to run setup whenever I change the source (I'd have to do that anyway...)</li>
<li>The build directory includes specific version information about the OS that changes on many Software Updates
(these don't happen too often, so it's not such a big deal).</li>
</ul>
<p>These can both be fixed, of course, with additional hacks - but I like to use as few hacks as possible
so that my development environment is easily reproducible.</p>
<p>There are two features I wish that the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-site.html">site</a> module had:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Tilde expansion in <tt class="docutils literal">.pth</tt> paths (e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">~/src/py2app/src</tt>, or to implement home-dir-site-packages on other platforms - assuming the next feature)</li>
<li>Promoting <tt class="docutils literal">.pth</tt> paths to become site directories of their own (so that they are scanned for additional <tt class="docutils literal">.pth</tt> files)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these can be hacked in with another undocumented feature: you can cause arbitrary code to be run during this
process if the line starts with an <tt class="docutils literal">import</tt> statement.  Due to the way it's implemented, you can run arbitrary code in one of two ways (the second way requires two files):</p>
<p><strong>hack1.pth</strong></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# The module imported is not important, it's used only to
# trigger the execution of the following line.
import sys; print &quot;hack1 installed!&quot;
</pre>
<p><strong>hack2.pth</strong></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# This simply uses an additional module that implements the hack.
# It's probably &quot;preferable&quot; to ``hack1.pth`` as it doesn't depend
# on side-effects of the implementation.  The feature isn't
# documented anyway, so you may be on your own anyway...
import hack2
</pre>
<p><strong>hack2.py</strong></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
print &quot;hack2 installed&quot;
</pre>
{% endraw %}
