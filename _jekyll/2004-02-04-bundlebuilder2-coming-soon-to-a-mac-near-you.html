title: bundlebuilder2 -- coming soon to a mac near you

<p>For the past.. while.. I've been slowly hacking at a refactoring of <a class="reference external" href="http://pythonmac.org/wiki/BundleBuilder">bundlebuilder</a> that uses my (unreleased) macholib package.  Here's what the new bundlebuilder will do:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(complete) In addition to automatically finding modules when in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--semi-standalone</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--standalone</span></tt> mode, it will <em>also</em> find non-System dylibs and frameworks!</li>
<li>(complete) It properly rewrites mach-o headers on everything such that they have load commands referencing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;executable_path/../Frameworks</span></tt> rather than their original paths.</li>
<li>(in progress) Configurable detection of packages that should be included whole, such as <a class="reference external" href="http://pygame.org/">pygame</a>, because it references data files via <tt class="docutils literal">__file__</tt> (breaking zip import).</li>
<li>(planned, to be released separately) a <a class="reference external" href="http://pyobjc.sf.net/">PyObjC</a> GUI for bundlebuilder2, that makes all of this even more configurable and easy to use.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For the interested, macholib is basically a Python-rewrite of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/include/mach-o</span></tt> headers, which a subset of the functionality from <a class="reference external" href="x-man-page://otool">otool</a> and <a class="reference external" href="x-man-page://install_name_tool">install_name_tool</a>.  Originally I had released something called potool that attempted to do these things, but I had made a few wrong assumptions, so I rewrote it all as macholib.</p>
<p>Honestly, the only things I can think of that otool has that I don't are symbolic disassembly, symbol table dumps, and useless things like printing a nice description of the threadstate load commands.  I actually do have a mostly-finished symbolic PPC disassembler written in Python, but it's an ugly port of some of GCC's guts and I doubt it'd be a good idea to unleash it on the world :)</p>
