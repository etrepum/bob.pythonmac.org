I gave a talk at [PyCon 2010](http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/) in Atlanta last month called [Analysis: The Other Kind of Testing](http://bitbucket.org/etrepum/analysis_pycon_2010/) ([video](http://blip.tv/file/3321657)). It's a very simple overview of techniques such as split testing (AB testing) and a call to action to improve [django-lean](http://bitbucket.org/akoha/django-lean/).

Atlanta was a fantastic location for PyCon 2010, and I look forward to returning next year. Hopefully if I give another talk I'll be able to put a little more time into it :)

As per usual, I've been incredibly lazy about updating this blog, so you're much better off following [@etrepum](http://twitter.com/etrepum) on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/etrepum).
