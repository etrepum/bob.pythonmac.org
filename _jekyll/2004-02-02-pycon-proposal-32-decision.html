<p>My <a class="reference external" href="http://pycon.org/">PyCon</a> proposal, 60 Minutes of MacPython, has been accepted.  I'll be speaking about Darwin, Apple Events, Cocoa (PyObjC), and the MacPython community.</p>
<p>For those of you interested (and you should be, there are plenty of other good talks and tutorials this year), it's not too late to get yourself a ticket.  Even though early-bird registration just ended, it's still pretty cheap for a conference (remember: 3 days + 4 days of optional sprints!).  It was great last year, I'm sure it'll be even better this time around (word has it that someone is even planning an afterparty for the second night).</p>
