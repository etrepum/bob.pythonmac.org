<dt>UPDATE:</dt>
<dd>There are more examples, and a real site for <a class="reference external" href="http://mochikit.com/">MochiKit</a> now.  Check out <a class="reference external" href="http://mochikit.com/">mochikit.com</a>.</dd>

<p>As some of you know, <a class="reference external" href="http://mochikit.com/">MochiKit</a> is a badass lightweight JavaScript library that implements some very cool stuff.  We've been working on it from a <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.red-bean.com/mochikit/trunk">public subversion repository</a> (thanks <a class="reference external" href="http://red-bean.com/">red-bean</a>!) for some time now, but haven't had the time to finish the site or package up the distribution .  It's very close, and has been more than usable for weeks now.</p>
<p>If you're into edges and bleeding, check out: <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.red-bean.com/mochikit/trunk">http://svn.red-bean.com/mochikit/trunk</a></p>
<p>There's currently exactly one example, <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.red-bean.com/mochikit/trunk/examples/sortable_tables/index.html">Sortable Tables from Scratch with MochiKit</a>, which shows off just a smidge of what <a class="reference external" href="http://mochikit.com/">MochiKit</a> makes easy.  The particular example follows the &quot;unobtrusive javascript&quot; buzz train and adds column sorting to a table that would otherwise display and look just fine if no JavaScript interpreter were available.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.red-bean.com/mochikit/trunk/doc/html/MochiKit/">documentation</a> is really shaping up, but is completely unstyled at the moment, so shield your eyes for now.  The <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.red-bean.com/mochikit/trunk/doc/rst/MochiKit/">reStructuredText documentation</a> might be more palatable in the interim.</p>
<p>Look out for <a class="reference external" href="http://mochikit.com/">MochiKit</a>'s imminent release here and on <a class="reference external" href="http://openjsan.org/">JSAN</a>!</p>
<p>If you want to see more of <a class="reference external" href="http://mochikit.com/">MochiKit</a> in action, check out its sugar daddy: <a class="reference external" href="http://mochibot.com/">MochiBot</a>.  <a class="reference external" href="http://mochibot.com/">MochiBot</a> is a tricked out traffic monitoring system for Flash content (that <em>really</em> shines if you're doing a viral campaign or want to watch your game spread over the internet).  If you're a Flash developer, you ought to find <a class="reference external" href="http://mochibot.com/">MochiBot</a> pretty damn cool, and this is just the beginning of many services we're working on at <a class="reference external" href="http://mochimedia.com/">Mochi Media</a>.  It's still beta, but it's free.  Free is good.</p>
<p>All of the tables in the <a class="reference external" href="http://mochibot.com/">MochiBot</a> UI are sortable (when that makes sense) and are loaded on the fly by XMLHttpRequest.  This makes the interface just about as responsive as it gets for a browser, and you can refresh the data in a fraction of a second if you just can't wait to see how your Flash content is doing.  There's even some cute little sparklines on the dashboard!</p>
