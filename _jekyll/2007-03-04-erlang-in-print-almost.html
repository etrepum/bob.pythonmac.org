<p><a class="reference external" href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a> finally has a book out in print again (almost): <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/jaerlang/">Programming Erlang</a>, written by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sics.se/~joe/index.html">Joe Armstrong</a>. The best part of the story is that the publisher is allowing a combo purchase of a beta PDF plus the print book when it's available. How cool is that? I think this model makes a <em>lot</em> of sense with the speed that technologies move these days. Imagine how much they could have made riding the Ruby on Rails hype train a few months earlier than any other publisher with a 70% finished beta PDF plus a print book when available?</p>
<p>I've purchased the book and read through what's available in the beta PDF so far. It definitely does not disappoint: this is <em>the</em> <a class="reference external" href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a> book and it will be for some time to come.</p>
<p>If you're particularly interested I also highly recommend reading <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sics.se/~joe/index.html">Joe Armstrong</a>'s doctoral thesis paper (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sics.se/~joe/thesis/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf">Making Reliable Systems in the Presence of Software Errors</a>), which has a lot of overlap with what the beta PDF covers and what the book will cover when it's finished. There's also a lot of interesting information in the thesis that may or may not end up in the book such as the history and evolution of <a class="reference external" href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a> and some interesting case studies.</p>
