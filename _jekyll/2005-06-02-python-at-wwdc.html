<p>For those of you attending <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC 2005</a> next week, make sure to check out the Python related sessions:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>602 A.M.P. on Mac OS X:</dt>
<dd><a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/schedule/tuesday_am.html">Tue, 9:00-10:30</a>, North Beach</dd>
<dt>613 Python on Mac OS X:</dt>
<dd><a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/schedule/wednesday_am.html">Wed, 9:00-10:30</a>, North Beach</dd>
</dl>
<p>Additionally, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/~guido/">Guido</a> is going to be speaking about Python at the <a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/events/brownbag.html#python">Wednesday Brown Bag Lunches With O'Reilly</a> (Wed, 12:45pm).</p>
<p>Oh, and if you're looking to complain about the lack of Python support (or public APIs so that third parties can do the hard work) in Xcode, here's where to express that opinion:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>410 Developer Tools Feedback Forum:</dt>
<dd><a class="reference external" href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/schedule/friday_pm.html">Fri, 5:00-6:00</a>, Russian Hill</dd>
</dl>
<p>There isn't a Python/PyObjC BOF arranged yet.  If you're interested in making that happen, find me after session 613 on Wednesday morning.  I don't really know the area, but <a class="reference external" href="http://bbum.pycs.net/">bbum</a> does (more than me, anyway), and he should be around at about the same time too.</p>
