<p>I created a small Cocoa Bindings example in the PyObjC CVS repository last night, and decided to follow it up with a step by step tutorial.  I figured this would be useful as the demonstration I gave during my PyCon talk isn't anywhere in my slides.</p>
<p>The tutorial assumes you are using PyObjC CVS (or whatever release comes after 1.1b1).  In order to set up an appropriate environment you will have to perform the following steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Make sure you're running OS X 10.3 or later, and you have the latest Xcode installed.  If not, it's time to upgrade.  Cocoa Bindings are not available in previous versions of OS X.</li>
<li>Check out <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=14534">PyObjC CVS</a></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">sudo python setup.py install</tt></li>
<li>Make the folder <tt class="docutils literal">/Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/Project Templates</tt></li>
<li>Copy <tt class="docutils literal">Xcode/Project <span class="pre">Templates/Cocoa-Python</span> Application</tt> from your PyObjC checkout into that folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>The finished example is in <tt class="docutils literal">Examples/CocoaBindings/TableModel</tt> of the PyObjC source tree, but the tutorial (<a class="reference external" href="http://undefined.org/python/passwdviewer_cocoabindings_tutorial.pdf">PasswdViewer Tutorial PDF</a>) is self-contained so using the finished example is not going to teach you anything about Interface Builder or creating projects with the new template.</p>
<p>If you're interested in how I created the tutorial, here is the <a class="reference external" href="http://undefined.org/python/passwdviewer_cocoabindings_tutorial.txt">reStructuredText source document</a>.  Note that the screenshots are crucial to getting the hang of this, so you should really be using the PDF.  I'll post the code I used to create the tutorial PDF (and my PyCon slides) at some point in the future if there is interest, but it's merely a small hack of the PythonPoint output code already in docutils CVS (somewhere in the sandbox).</p>
