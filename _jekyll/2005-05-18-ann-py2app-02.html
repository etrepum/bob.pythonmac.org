<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://undefined.org/python/#py2app">py2app 0.2</a> is a minor bug fix release.  You can download it from <a class="reference external" href="http://pythonmac.org/packages/">pythonmac.org packages</a>.  <a class="reference external" href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">PyObjC</a> 1.3.5 ships with py2app 0.2, so if you have that, you have already upgraded to py2app 0.2!</p>
<p>Functional changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>New datamodels option to support CoreData.  Compiles
.xcdatamodel files and places them in the Resources dir
(as .mom).</li>
<li>New use-pythonpath option.  The py2app application bootstrap
will no longer use entries from PYTHONPATH unless this option
is used.</li>
<li>py2app now persists information about the build environment
(python version, executable, build style, etc.) in the
Info.plist and will clean the executable before rebuilding
if anything at all has changed.</li>
<li>bdist_mpkg now builds packages with the full platform info,
so that installing a package for one platform combination
will not look like an upgrade to another platform combination.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug Fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fixed a bug in standalone building, where a rebuild could
cause an unlaunchable executable.</li>
<li>Plugin bootstrap should compile/link correctly
with gcc 4.</li>
<li>Plugin bootstrap no longer sets PYTHONHOME and will
restore PYTHONPATH after initialization.</li>
<li>Plugin bootstrap swaps out thread state upon plug-in
load if it is the first to initialize Python.  This
fixes threading issues.</li>
</ul>
