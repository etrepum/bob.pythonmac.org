title: Pure python &quot;structseq&quot; factory

<p>This is a pattern I've been playing with lately (to be used in the next version of <a class="reference external" href="http://undefined.org/python/#aeve">aeve</a>, in the aeut/aete decoder).  Basically it's a factory for &quot;tuples with a little metadata that can be used a little bit like dicts too&quot;.  Yeah I know that dict-like methods will stomp on names if there's a clash, but I don't have any use cases where that happens so my implementation doesn't consider that.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def newNamedTupleType(typename, names):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Return a subtype of tuple with named accessors&quot;&quot;&quot;
    dct = dict([(_name, property(lambda self,_i=_i:self[_i], doc=_name)) for (_i, _name) in enumerate(names)])
    dct['__names__']    = names
    dct['keys']         = lambda self: self.__names__
    dct['items']        = lambda self: zip(self.__names__, self)
    dct['iteritems']    = lambda self: itertools.izip(self.__names__, self)
    dct['values']       = lambda self: self
    return type(typename, (tuple,), dct)
</pre>
<p>It's primarily useful in conjunction with the struct module, for example, to unpack a version record, which is a pair of 16bit words, you could use something like the following:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import struct
VersionRecord = newNamedTupleType('VersionRecord', ('major', 'minor'))

def decodeVersionRecordFromPackedString(s):
    return VersionRecord(struct.unpack('HH', s))

def prettyPrintVersionRecordFromPackedString(s):
    rec = decodeVersionRecordFromPackedString(s)
    print &quot;%(major)s.%(minor)s&quot; % dict(rec.iteritems())
</pre>
<p>Yes, the example is contrived.  But it really does make things easier when you're passing non-trivial versions of these around.  Instead of having to remember the index of a field, you can just remember the name.  In my typical use case, these names come from C structures, so it makes the Python code closer to what a C implementation would be like (in a good way).</p>
<p>I have a more generic (but mutable and not nearly as lightweight) solution to this problem (making structures easier to work with), currently called &quot;ptypes&quot; since it is so much like ctypes Structures API-wise.  It's currently being used in a pure python package (macholib, formerly potool) for reading/writing Mach-O headers (the OS X analog of Linux's ELF, or Win32's PE).  macholib is useful for dependency walking, and automation of install_name_tool like functionality.  However, since it also understands symbol tables, it would be useful for determining if a particular source file contains Objective C class definitions.. which is good to know because Objective C classes can not be unloaded at runtime.  It could even be used to write a symbolic debugger if one were so inclined.  I have written a largely untested symbolic PowerPC disassembler in Python, so it would be neat to hook the two together eventually.</p>
