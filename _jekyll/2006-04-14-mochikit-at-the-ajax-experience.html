<p>For all of you ajaxians out there, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theajaxexperience.com/">The Ajax Experience</a> is coming up next month!  From the roster it looks like it's going to be quite the conference.  There are representatives speaking for quite a few of the ajax-related frameworks and libraries (including my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theajaxexperience.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=272">Intro to MochiKit</a>), as well as the people responsible for JavaScript, JSON, and just about everything else a &quot;web 2.0&quot; developer should be intimately familiar with.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.theajaxexperience.com/">The Ajax Experience</a> runs from May 10th-12th at the Westin St. Francis right here in rainy San Francisco.</p>
<p>For those of you not able to attend, I will definitely be making all of my presentation materials available after the talk, but I would highly recommend showing up if you can.  In my experience, the talks are the least interesting part of any conference.</p>
