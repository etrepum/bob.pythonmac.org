<p>One of the biggest <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/prototype-and-object-prototype.html">stumbling blocks</a> most people bash into when learning JavaScript is the &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">this</tt>&quot; variable.  <tt class="docutils literal">this</tt> is a special variable (like <tt class="docutils literal">arguments</tt>) that's always bound to some object.  By default, <tt class="docutils literal">this</tt> is bound to the global object, which is typically going to be <tt class="docutils literal">document.window</tt> in a browser.  However, there are two things that can temporarily bind it to something else:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>JavaScript's magical <tt class="docutils literal">foo.bar()</tt> call syntax.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://developer-test.mozilla.org/en/docs/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference:Objects:Function:apply">Function.prototype.apply</a> (or <a class="reference external" href="http://developer-test.mozilla.org/en/docs/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference:Objects:Function:call">Function.prototype.call</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>You can demonstrate JavaScript's magical (read: completely stick-your-head-in-a-blender stupid) treatment of &quot;foo.bar()&quot; call syntax with the following snippet:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
foo = {
    'bar': function () {
        alert(this);
    },
    'toString': function () {
        return 'foo';
    }
};
foo.bar();
(foo.bar)();
(foo.bar || null)();
bar = foo.bar; bar();
</pre>
<p>The first call, <tt class="docutils literal">foo.bar()</tt> is the &quot;call with this&quot; syntax, so you should get an alert with &quot;foo&quot;.</p>
<p>The second call, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(foo.bar)()</span></tt> is technically &quot;just call&quot; syntax, but some JavaScript interpreters will interpret it as the same AST as the first one.  For example, Safari will still say &quot;foo&quot; here, but Firefox will say &quot;[object Window]&quot;.</p>
<p>The third call is unambiguously &quot;just call&quot; syntax, so you will get &quot;[object Window]&quot; here.  I suppose if Safari gets any smarter, it might give the wrong answer here someday ;)</p>
<p>And the fourth is really really unambiguous &quot;just call&quot; syntax, so you will get &quot;[object Window]&quot; here as well.</p>
<p>Bah.</p>
<p>As for apply and call, it's basically the same thing except you spell it backwards.  Instead of <tt class="docutils literal">foo.bar()</tt> you say <tt class="docutils literal">bar = foo.bar; bar.apply(foo, [])</tt>.  This is particularly useful, but it's only necessary because JavaScript is dumb and doesn't have bound methods or anything like Python's <tt class="docutils literal">*args</tt> variable argument <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/ref/calls.html">call syntax</a>.</p>
