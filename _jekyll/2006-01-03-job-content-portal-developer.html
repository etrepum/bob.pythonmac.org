<p>Our company, <a class="reference external" href="http://mochimedia.com/">Mochi Media LLC</a>, is in need of a web developer to put together a content portal site (ideally with the <a class="reference external" href="http://turbogears.org/">TurboGears</a> stack) on a contract basis.  Being located in the San Francisco bay area is a huge bonus, as is working knowledge of Macromedia Flash and JavaScript.</p>
<p>If you're interested, please contact us at: <a class="reference external" href="mailto:work&#64;mochimedia.com">work&#64;mochimedia.com</a></p>
<p>Please include relevant experience (especially high volume web development work) and some code samples (open source is best).</p>
