<p>I've ended up using Perl in a few of my otherwise Python programs just to get Excel spreadsheets (via Spreadsheet::WriteExcel).</p>
<p>Never again, apparently Evgeny Filatov (who must hate Perl a little more than I do) did the hard work for us by porting it from Perl: <a class="reference external" href="http://pyxlwriter.sourceforge.net/">pyXLWriter</a>.  Currently, it sports all the same features as Spreadsheet::WriteExcel, except for BigFile support (7 MB+), because of the OLE::Storage_Lite dependency.</p>
