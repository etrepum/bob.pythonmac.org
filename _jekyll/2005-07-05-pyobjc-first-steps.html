<!-- -*- mode: rst -*- -->
<p>I've been neglecting Python a bit lately, but Ronald is going to cut a release of <a class="reference external" href="http://pyobjc.sf.net/">PyObjC</a> 1.3.7 very soon, hopefully later this week.  <a class="reference external" href="http://pyobjc.sf.net/">PyObjC</a> 1.3.7 fixes a few bugs (particularly with Xcode 2.1 templates), has a more complete wrapping of Mac OS X 10.4 system frameworks (DiscRecording, SenTestingKit, SecurityFoundation), and adds a new TinyURLService example (which converts URLs on the pasteboard to <a class="reference external" href="http://tinyurl.com/">tinyurl.com</a> equivalents).</p>
<p>There's also a swath of new &quot;First Steps&quot; documentation in the PyObjC intro, which I wrote up earlier today:</p>
<div class="section" id="first-steps">
<h2>First Steps</h2>
<p>When dealing with the Objective-C runtime, there are certain patterns
you need to learn when writing Python code.  If you're not already an
Objective-C programmer, some of them will seem strange or even
&quot;un-pythonic&quot; at first.  However, you will get used to it, and the way
that PyObjC works is quite compliant with the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0020.html">Zen of Python</a>
(<tt class="docutils literal">import this</tt>).  In fact, Ronald is Dutch ;)</p>
<p>With no further ado, here are the three most important things you
<em>must</em> know before embarking on any PyObjC voyage:</p>
<div class="section" id="underscores-and-lots-of-them">
<h3>Underscores, and lots of them</h3>
<p>Objective-C objects communicate with each other by sending messages.
The syntax for messages is somewhere in-between Python's positional and
keyword arguments.  Specificlaly, Objective-C message dispatch uses
positional arguments, but parts of the message name (called &quot;selector&quot;
in Objective-C terminology) are interleaved with the arguments.</p>
<p>An Objective-C message looks like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[someObject doSomething:arg1 withSomethingElse:arg2];
</pre>
<p>The selector (message name) for the above snippet is this (note the colons):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
doSomething:withSomethingElse:
</pre>
<p>In order to have a lossless and unambiguous translation between Objective-C
messages and Python methods, the Python method name equivalent is simply
the selector with colons replaced by underscores.  Since each colon in an
Objective-C selector is a placeholder for an argument, the number of
underscores in the PyObjC-ified method name is the number of arguments
that should be given.</p>
<p>The PyObjC translation of the above selector is (note the underscores):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
doSomething_withSomethingElse_
</pre>
<p>The message dispatch, translated to PyObjC, looks like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
someObject.doSomething_withSomethingElse_(arg1, arg2)
</pre>
<p><em>Methods that take one argument will have a trailing underscore</em>.</p>
<p>It may take a little while to get used to, but PyObjC does not ever
rename selectors.  The trailing underscore will seem strange at first,
especially for cases like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# note the trailing underscore
someObject.setValue_(aValue)
</pre>
<p>There are a few additional rules regarding message dispatch, see the
Overview of the bridge for the complete rundown.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="two-phase-instantiation">
<h3>Two-phase instantiation</h3>
<p>Objective-C, being a low-level runtime, separates the two concepts required
to instantiate an object.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>allocation:</dt>
<dd>Reserve a chunk of memory large enough to hold the new object, and make
sure that all of its declared instance variables are set to &quot;zero&quot;
(this means nil pointers to objects, 0 for integers, etc.).</dd>
<dt>initialization:</dt>
<dd>Fill in the blank slate allocated by the allocation phase.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In Objective-C, the convention is for allocation to be performed by a class
method called <tt class="docutils literal">alloc</tt>, and initialization is done with method
<em>beginning with</em> the word <tt class="docutils literal">init</tt>.  For example, here is the syntax for
instantiating an <tt class="docutils literal">NSObject</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
myObject = NSObject.alloc().init()
</pre>
<p>And here is an example for creating an <tt class="docutils literal">NSData</tt> instance given a few bytes:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
myData = NSData.alloc().initWithBytes_length_('the bytes', 9)
</pre>
<p>You must also follow this convention when subclassing Objective-C classes.
When initializing, an object must always (directly or indirectly) call the
designated initializer of its <tt class="docutils literal">super</tt>.  The designated initializer is the
&quot;most basic&quot; initializer through which all initialization eventually ends up.
The designated initializer for <tt class="docutils literal">NSObject</tt> is <tt class="docutils literal">init</tt>.  To find the
designated initializer for other classes, consult the documentation for that
class.  Here is an example of an <tt class="docutils literal">NSObject</tt> subclass with a customized
initialization phase:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class MyClass(NSObject):

    def init(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        Designated initializer for MyClass
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        # ALWAYS call the super's designated initializer.
        # Also, make sure to re-bind &quot;self&quot; just in case it
        # returns something else!
        self = super(MyClass, self).init()

        self.myVariable = 10

        # Unlike Python's __init__, initializers MUST return self,
        # because they are allowed to return any object!
        return self

class MyOtherClass(MyClass):

    def initWithOtherVariable_(self, otherVariable):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        Designated initializer for MyOtherClass
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        self = super(MyOtherClass, self).init()
        self.otherVariable = otherVariable
        return self

myInstance = MyClass.alloc().init()
myOtherInstance = MyOtherClass.alloc().initWithOtherVariable_(20)
</pre>
<p>Many Objective-C classes provide class methods that perform two-phase
instantiation for you in one step.  Several examples of this are:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# This is equivalent to:
#
#   myObject = NSObject.alloc().init()
#
myObject = NSObject.new()

# This is equivalent to:
#
#   myDict = NSDictionary.alloc().init()
#
myDict = NSDictionary.dictionary()

# This is equivalent to:
#
#   myString = NSString.alloc().initWithString_(u'my string')
#
myString = NSString.stringWithString_(u'my string')
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="objective-c-uses-accessors-everywhere">
<h3>Objective-C uses accessors everywhere</h3>
<p>Unlike Python, Objective-C convention says to use accessors rather than
directly accessing instance variables of other objects.  This means
that in order to access an instance variable <tt class="docutils literal">value</tt> of an object
<tt class="docutils literal">valueContainer</tt> you will have to use the following syntax:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# Getting
#
# notice the method call
#
myValue = valueContainer.value()

# Setting
#
# notice the naming convention and trailing underscore
#
valueContainer.setValue_(myNewValue)
</pre>
<p>When writing your own classes from Python, this is a bit harder since
Python only has one namespace for all attributes, even methods.  If you
choose to implement accessors from Python, then you will have to name
the instance variable something else:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class MyValueHolder(NSObject):

    def initWithValue_(self, value):
        self = super(MyValueHolder, self).init()
        # It's recommended not to use typical Python convention here,
        # as instance variables prefixed with underscores are reserved
        # by the Objective-C runtime.  It still works if you use
        # underscores, however.
        self.ivar_value = value
        return self

    def value(self):
        return self.ivar_value

    def setValue_(self, value):
        self.ivar_value = value
</pre>
<p>It's also possible to use Key-Value Coding in some cases, which eliminates
the need for writing most accessors, but only in scenarios where the rest of
the code is using it.</p>
