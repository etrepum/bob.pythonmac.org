<p>Well, I've installed <a class="reference external" href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, because it was a lot easier than anything else that can use <a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sf.net/">reStructuredText</a>.  I'm using a slightly <a class="reference external" href="http://pythonmac.org/bob/rest-plugin.txt">modified version</a> of <a class="reference external" href="http://goldenspud.com/webrog/archives/2004/12/23/rest-easy-with-wordpress/">this plugin</a>.  Hopefully I'll be able to whip together some quick scripts to import all of the entries from the old PyDS (ughh) blog and post them here, probably with the XML-RPC interface.</p>
<p>This post was written with <a class="reference external" href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> 1.0, but I would like something that understands <a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sf.net/">reStructuredText</a> in the future.  Maybe a future version will allow me to write a <a class="reference external" href="http://pyobjc.sf.net/">PyObjC</a> plugin that gives it this support?</p>
