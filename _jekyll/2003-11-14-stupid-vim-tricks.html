<dt>In some projects, like PyObjC, the coding style is to use tabs in C/Objective-C code, and spaces in Python.  I'm lazy, and haven't set it to do this on load, and I often forget to <cite>:set noet</cite> (not expand tabs) in vim.  The quick trick I use to convert tabs to spaces (or vice versa) is to:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>set/unset <cite>et</cite> as appropriate</li>
<li>make sure my <cite>sw</cite> (shiftwidth) and <cite>ts</cite> (tabstop) are both 4 (this is in my .vimrc)</li>
<li>indent the block of code once (this converts, but gives me extra indent) with <cite>&gt;</cite> in visual mode</li>
<li>dedent it with <cite>&lt;</cite> in visual mode</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Voila, the whole mess is now converted from tabs to spaces or vice versa.  Here's what I find to be comfortable in my <cite>.vimrc</cite> (I do have some custom stuff for python, pyrex, coloring, etc. but that's not as important):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
set ffs=unix,dos,mac
set ts=4
set bs=2
set et
set sw=4
set sm
set sta
set sts=4
set ai
</pre>
