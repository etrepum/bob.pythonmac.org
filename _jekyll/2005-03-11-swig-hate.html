<p><a class="reference external" href="http://swig.sourceforge.net/">SWIG</a> should definitely win the prize for worst implementation of a good idea, ever.  Automatic wrapping of code sounds great, right?  Well, it could be, but it's most certainly not.  To the point where I can only recommend <a class="reference external" href="http://swig.sourceforge.net/">SWIG</a> to people that I really don't like.</p>
<p>Why must they break things in <em>EVERY SINGLE CONSECUTIVE RELEASE</em>?!  Do they hate us?  Are they secretly fighting to keep C as the first and foremost language in open source development?</p>
<p>I'm thankful that I have always had the common sense to avoid using <a class="reference external" href="http://swig.sourceforge.net/">SWIG</a> for my own projects, but I've had more than my own share of headaches maintaining software that depends on the beast, like <a class="reference external" href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/">PyOpenGL</a>.  As you can probably guess, that's what I'm dealing with right now.  Although gouging my eyes out with a toothpick would be more pleasurable.  I hope the devleopers of SWIG don't put it on their resume, cause it sure wouldn't get them hired anywhere I work.</p>
