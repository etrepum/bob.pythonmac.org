<p>I've just received official notice that both of my 30 minute <a class="reference external" href="http://pycon.org/">PyCon</a> proposals have been accepted for <a class="reference external" href="http://pycon.org/dc2005">PyCon 2005</a>!  I took a look at the list of other accepted proposals, and there was definitely some stiff competition.  If you're close enough to go, you should.  I've been the past two years, and it's top notch and affordable.  I highly recommend it, regardless of your Python experience or specialization.</p>
<p>#57. <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.red-bean.com/bob/pycon/2005/trunk/proposal/PyObjC_Intro-30min-2005.txt">Introduction to PyObjC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Introduction to PyObjC is a quick tour of PyObjC suitable for anyone with
Python experience looking to get their feet wet with Cocoa development
using their programming language of choice.  Prior Objective-C knowledge
or Interface Builder experience is not necessary.</blockquote>
<p>#58. <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.red-bean.com/bob/pycon/2005/trunk/proposal/PyObjC_Hacking-30min-2005.txt">PyObjC Hacking</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
PyObjC Hacking is a quick tour of advanced uses for PyObjC and related
tools.  This talk is geared toward those who have a working knowledge
of PyObjC (or at least attended Introduction to PyObjC) and ideally
understand data structures at the C level.</blockquote>
