<ul class="simple">
<li>Food is cheap in Taipei and Shanghai</li>
<li>Alcohol isn't</li>
<li>US internet connectivity in Taipei is kinda slow and high latency</li>
<li>US internet connectivity in Shanghai is even worse; barely usable</li>
<li>An earthquake in Taiwan can make Shanghai's US connectivity completely unusable for days. Going on 6 now; still slower than dial-up 10 years ago.</li>
<li>The great firewall blocking sites like wikipedia, google's cache and wordpress can get annoying. It's also hard to tell if a site is just unreachable or is blocked by the great firewall.</li>
<li>Google knows what the hell they're doing (and nobody else seems to). They're the only US company I've found that has maintained a usable infrastructure in Shanghai through this whole mess. Not Yahoo, not Microsoft, just Google. If Google had a proxy, I could've gotten by pretty nicely.</li>
<li>Localized sites for US companies work fine because they're hosted domestically, but I can't read them (e.g. apple.com.cn).</li>
<li>MacBook Pro power supplies really do melt, and they cost twice as much in Shanghai than <em>retail</em> from Apple in the US. No wonder people outside the US don't buy Apple!</li>
